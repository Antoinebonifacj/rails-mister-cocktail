Traditionally, vodka is made by the distillation of fermented cereal grains or potatoes, though some modern brands use other substances, such as fruits or sugar.\r\n\r\nSince the 1890s, the standard Polish, Russian, Belarusian, Ukrainian, Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian and Czech vodkas are 40% alcohol by volume ABV (80 US proof), a percentage that is widely misattributed to Dmitri Mendeleev. The European Union has established a minimum of 37.5% ABV for any \"European vodka\" to be named as such. Products sold as \"vodka\" in the United States must have a minimum alcohol content of 40%. Even with these loose restrictions, most vodka sold contains 40% ABV. For homemade vodkas and distilled beverages referred to as \"moonshine\", see moonshine by country.\r\n\r\nVodka is traditionally drunk neat (not mixed with any water, ice, or other mixer), though it is often served chilled in the vodka belt countries (Belarus, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Russia, Sweden, Ukraine). It is also commonly used in cocktails and mixed drinks, such as the vodka martini, Cosmopolitan, vodka tonic, Screwdriver, Greyhound, Black or White Russian, Moscow Mule, and Bloody Mary.\r\n\r\nScholars debate the beginnings of vodka. It is a contentious issue because very little historical material is available. For many centuries, beverages differed significantly compared to the vodka of today, as the spirit at that time had a different flavor, color and smell, and was originally used as medicine. It contained little alcohol, an estimated maximum of about 14%, as only this amount can be attained by natural fermentation. The still, allowing for distillation (\"burning of wine\"), increased purity, and increased alcohol content, was invented in the 8th century.\r\n\r\nA common property of the vodkas produced in the United States and Europe is the extensive use of filtration prior to any additional processing including the addition of flavorants. Filtering is sometimes done in the still during distillation, as well as afterwards, where the distilled vodka is filtered through activated charcoal and other media to absorb trace amounts of substances that alter or impart off-flavors to the vodka. However, this is not the case in the traditional vodka-producing nations, so many distillers from these countries prefer to use very accurate distillation but minimal filtering, thus preserving the unique flavors and characteristics of their products.\r\n\r\nThe master distiller is in charge of distilling the vodka and directing its filtration, which includes the removal of the \"fore-shots\", \"heads\" and \"tails\". These components of the distillate contain flavor compounds such as ethyl acetate and ethyl lactate (heads) as well as the fusel oils (tails) that impact the usually desired clean taste of vodka. Through numerous rounds of distillation, or the use of a fractioning still, the taste is modified and clarity is increased. In contrast, distillery process for liquors such as whiskey, rum, and baijiu allow portions of the \"heads\" and \"tails\" to remain, giving them their unique flavors.\r\n\r\nRepeated distillation of vodka will make its ethanol level much higher than is acceptable to most end users, whether legislation determines strength limits or not. Depending on the distillation method and the technique of the stillmaster, the final filtered and distilled vodka may have as much as 95–96% ethanol. As such, most vodka is diluted with water prior to bottling.\r\n\r\nPolish distilleries make a very pure (96%, 192 proof, formerly also 98%) rectified spirit (Polish language: spirytus rektyfikowany). Technically a form of vodka, it is sold in liquor stores rather than pharmacies. Similarly, the German market often carries German, Hungarian, Polish, and Ukrainian-made varieties of vodka of 90 to 95% ABV. A Bulgarian vodka, Balkan 176°, has an 88% alcohol content. Everclear, an American brand, is also sold at 95% ABV.","sort":"Vodka","alcohol":"Yes","perc":40,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/vodka.png"},{"id":2,"name":"gin","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:31.651Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:31.651Z","description":"Gin is a distilled alcoholic drink that derives its predominant flavour from juniper berries (Juniperus communis). Gin is one of the broadest categories of spirits, all of various origins, styles, and flavour profiles, that revolve around juniper as a common ingredient.\r\n\r\nFrom its earliest origins in the Middle Ages, the drink has evolved from a herbal medicine to an object of commerce in the spirits industry. Gin emerged in England after the introduction of the jenever, a Dutch liquor which originally had been a medicine. Although this development had been taking place since early 17th century, gin became widespread after the William of Orange-led 1688 Glorious Revolution and subsequent import restrictions on French brandy.\r\n\r\nGin today is produced in subtly different ways, from a wide range of herbal ingredients, giving rise to a number of distinct styles and brands. After juniper, gin tends to be flavoured with botanical/herbal, spice, floral or fruit-flavours or often a combination. It is most commonly consumed mixed with tonic water. Gin is also often used as a base spirit to produce flavoured gin-based liqueurs such as, for example, Sloe gin, traditionally by the addition of fruit, flavourings and sugar.","sort":"Gin","alcohol":"Yes","perc":40,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/gin.png"},{"id":3,"name":"rum","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:31.897Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:31.897Z","description":"Rum is a distilled alcoholic beverage made from sugarcane byproducts, such as molasses, or directly from sugarcane juice, by a process of fermentation and distillation. The distillate, a clear liquid, is then usually aged in oak barrels.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the world's rum production occurs in the Caribbean and Latin America. Rum is also produced in Scotland, Austria, Spain, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, the Philippines, India, Reunion Island, Mauritius, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, the United States, and Canada.\r\n\r\nRums are produced in various grades. Light rums are commonly used in cocktails, whereas \"golden\" and \"dark\" rums were typically consumed straight or neat, on the rocks, or used for cooking, but are now commonly consumed with mixers. Premium rums are also available, made to be consumed either straight or iced.\r\n\r\nRum plays a part in the culture of most islands of the West Indies as well as in The Maritimes and Newfoundland. This beverage has famous associations with the Royal Navy (where it was mixed with water or beer to make grog) and piracy (where it was consumed as bumbo). Rum has also served as a popular medium of economic exchange, used to help fund enterprises such as slavery (see Triangular trade), organized crime, and military insurgencies (e.g., the American Revolution and Australia's Rum Rebellion).\r\n\r\nThe precursors to rum date back to antiquity. Development of fermented drinks produced from sugarcane juice is believed to have first occurred either in ancient India or in China, and to have spread from there. An example of such an early drink is brum. Produced by the Malay people, brum dates back thousands of years. Marco Polo also recorded a 14th-century account of a \"very good wine of sugar\" that was offered to him in the area that became modern-day Iran.\r\n\r\nThe first distillation of rum took place on the sugarcane plantations of the Caribbean in the 17th century. Plantation slaves first discovered molasses, a byproduct of the sugar refining process, could be fermented into alcohol. Later, distillation of these alcoholic byproducts concentrated the alcohol and removed impurities, producing the first true rums. Tradition suggests rum first originated on the island of Barbados. However, in the decade of the 1620s, rum production was recorded in Brazil. A liquid identified as rum has been found in a tin bottle found on the Swedish warship Vasa, which sank in 1628.\r\n\r\nA 1651 document from Barbados stated, \"The chief fuddling they make in the island is Rumbullion, alias Kill-Divil, and thi is made of sugar canes distilled, a hot, hellish, and terrible liquor.\"","sort":"Rum","alcohol":"Yes","perc":40,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/rum.png"},{"id":4,"name":"tequila","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:32.087Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:32.087Z","description":"Tequila (Spanish pronunciation: [teˈkila] (About this sound listen)) is a regionally specific distilled beverage and type of alcoholic drink made from the blue agave plant, primarily in the area surrounding the city of Tequila, 65 km (40 mi) northwest of Guadalajara, and in the highlands (Los Altos) of the central western Mexican state of Jalisco. Aside from differences in region of origin, tequila is a type of mezcal (and the regions of production of the two drinks are overlapping). The distinction in the method of production is that tequila must use only blue agave plants rather than any type of agave. Tequila is commonly served neat in Mexico and as a shot with salt and lime across the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nThe red volcanic soil in the region around the city of Tequila is particularly well suited to the growing of the blue agave, and more than 300 million of the plants are harvested there each year. Agave grows differently depending on the region. Blue agaves grown in the highlands Los Altos region are larger in size and sweeter in aroma and taste. Agaves harvested in the lowlands, on the other hand, have a more herbaceous fragrance and flavor.\r\n\r\nMexican laws state that tequila can only be produced in the state of Jalisco and limited municipalities in the states of Guanajuato, Michoacán, Nayarit, and Tamaulipas. Tequila is recognized as a Mexican designation of origin product in more than 40 countries. It is protected through NAFTA in Canada and the United States,[6] through bilateral agreements with individual countries such as Japan and Israel, and has been a protected designation of origin product in the constituent countries of the European Union since 1997.\r\n\r\nTequila contains alcohol (also known formally as ethanol) and is most often made at a 38% alcohol content (76 U.S. proof) for domestic consumption, but can be produced between 31 and 55% alcohol content (62 and 110 U.S. proof).

The typical alcohol content is generally somewhere between 14% and 20% ABV. Its contents may be a blend of egg yolks, aromatic spirits, sugar or honey, brandy, vanilla and sometimes cream (or evaporated milk). Notable makers of advocaat include Bols, DeKuyper and Verpoorten.\r\n\r\nAdvocaat is the Dutch word for \"lawyer\". As the name of the drink, it is short for advocatenborrel, or \"lawyer's drink\", where borrel is Dutch for a small alcoholic beverage consumed slowly during a social gathering. According to the 1882 edition of the Woordenboek der Nederlandsche taal (Dictionary of the Dutch Language), it is \"zoo genoemd als een goed smeersel voor de keel, en dus bijzonder dienstig geacht voor een advocaat, die in 't openbaar het woord moet voeren\" (\"so named as a good lubricant for the throat, and thus considered especially useful for a lawyer, who must speak in public.\"\r\n\r\nThick advocaat is sold mainly on the Dutch and Belgian market, though in lesser quantities it can also be found in German and Austrian markets. It is often eaten with a little spoon, while a more liquid version is sold as an export. Thick advocaat contains egg yolks, and is used as a waffle or poffertjes topping and as an ingredient for several kinds of desserts such as ice cream, custards and pastries. It is also served as an apéritif or digestif in a wide glass with whipped cream and cocoa powder sprinkled on top.\r\n\r\nIn the export variety whole eggs are used. The best known cocktail using advocaat is the Snowball: a mixture of advocaat, sparkling lemonade and sometimes lime juice, (although this is not required for the drink) that is often consumed near Christmas.

In an 1824 essay about the word's origin, Samuel Morewood, a British etymologist, suggested it might be from the British slang term for \"the best\", as in \"having a rum time.\" He wrote:\n\nAs spirits, extracted from molasses, could not well be ranked under the name whiskey, brandy, or arrack, it would be called rum, to denote its excellence or superior quality.\n\nGiven the harsh taste of early rum, this is unlikely. Morewood later suggested another possibility: that it was taken from the last syllable of the Latin word for sugar, saccharum, an explanation commonly heard today.\n\nOther etymologists have mentioned the Romani word rum, meaning \"strong\" or \"potent\". These words have been linked to the ramboozle and rumfustian, both popular British drinks in the mid-17th century. However, neither was made with rum, but rather eggs, ale, wine, sugar, and various spices. The most probable origin is as a truncated version of rumbullion or rumbustion.[2] Both words surfaced in English about the same time as rum did (Joan Coromines states 1651 as the first recording of \"rumbullion\", and 1654 for \"rum\" -1770 for the first recording in Spanish of ron), and were slang terms for \"tumult\" or \"uproar\". This is a far more convincing explanation, and brings the image of fractious men fighting in entanglements at island tippling houses, which are early versions of the bar.\n\nAnother claim is the name is from the large drinking glasses used by Dutch seamen known as rummers, from the Dutch word roemer, a drinking glass.[3] Other options include contractions of the words iterum, Latin for \"again, a second time\", or arôme, French for aroma.\n\nRegardless of the original source, the name was already in common use by 1654, when the General Court of Connecticut ordered the confiscations of \"whatsoever Barbados liquors, commonly called rum, kill devil and the like\". A short time later in May 1657, the General Court of Massachusetts also decided to make illegal the sale of strong liquor \"whether knowne by the name of rumme, strong water, wine, brandy, etc.\"\n\nIn current usage, the name used for a rum is often based on its place of origin.\n\nFor rums from Spanish-speaking locales, the word ron is used. A ron añejo (\"old rum\") indicates a rum that has been significantly aged and is often used for premium products.\n\nRhum is the term that typically distinguishes rum made from fresh sugar cane juice from rum made from molasses in French-speaking locales like Martinique. A rhum vieux (\"old rum\") is an aged French rum that meets several other requirements.\n\nSome of the many other names for rum are Nelson's blood, kill-devil, demon water, pirate's drink, navy neaters, and Barbados water. A version of rum from Newfoundland is referred to by the name screech, while some low-grade West Indies rums are called tafia.","sort":"Rum","alcohol":"Yes","perc":38,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/aejo rum.png"},{"id":11,"name":"aftershock","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:33.754Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:33.754Z","description":"This cinnamon flavoured liqueur has proved immensely popular since its introduction.

Agave syrup is sweeter than honey and tends to be less viscous. Most agave syrup comes from Mexico and South Africa.\r\n\r\nTo produce agave syrup from the Agave americana and A. tequilana plants, the leaves are cut off the plant after it has been growing for seven to fourteen years. The juice is then extracted from the core of the agave, called the piña. The juice is filtered, then heated to break the complex components (the polysaccharides) into simple sugars.[citation needed] The main polysaccharide is called inulin or fructosan and is mostly fructose. This filtered juice is then concentrated to a syrupy liquid, slightly thinner than honey. Its color varies from light- to dark-amber, depending on the degree of processing.\r\n\r\nAgave salmiana is processed differently from Agave tequiliana. As the plant develops, it starts to grow a stalk called a quiote. The stalk is cut off before it fully grows, creating a hole in the center of the plant that fills with a liquid called aguamiel. The liquid is collected daily. The liquid is then heated, breaking down its complex components into fructose and glucose and preventing it from fermenting into pulque.\r\n\r\nAn alternative method used to process the agave juice without heat is described in a United States patent for a process that uses enzymes derived from the mold Aspergillus niger to convert the inulin-rich extract into fructose.

Historically, the term referred to a drink brewed without hops.\r\n\r\nAs with most beers, ale typically has a bittering agent to balance the sweetness of the malt and act as a preservative. Ale was originally bittered with gruit, a mixture of herbs or spices boiled in the wort before fermentation. Later, hops replaced gruit as the bittering agent.\r\n\r\nAle, along with bread, was an important source of nutrition in the medieval world, particularly small beer, also known as table beer or mild beer, which was highly nutritious, contained just enough alcohol to act as a preservative, and provided hydration without intoxicating effects. Small beer would have been consumed daily by almost everyone, including children, in the medieval world, with higher-alcohol ales served for recreational purposes. The lower cost for proprietors combined with the lower taxes levied on small beer led to the selling of beer labeled \"strong beer\" that had actually been diluted with small beer. In medieval times, ale may have been safer to drink than most water (the germ theory of disease was unheard of, and the sterilizing properties of boiling unknown); however, there is no period evidence that people were aware of this nor that they chose to drink ale for this reason. The alcohol, hops, and some ingredients in gruit used to preserve some ales may have contributed to their lower load of pathogens, when compared to water. However, ale was largely safer due to the hours of boiling required in production, not the alcoholic content of the finished beverage.\r\n\r\nBrewing ale in the Middle Ages was a local industry primarily pursued by women. Brewsters, or alewives, would brew in the home for both domestic consumption and small scale commercial sale. Brewsters provided a substantial supplemental income for families; however, only in select few cases, as was the case for widows, was brewing considered the primary income of the household.\r\n\r\nThe word ale is related to the Old English alu or ealu, aloth and ealoth in the genitive and dative. It is believed to stem from Proto-Indo-European root *alu-, through Proto-Germanic *aluth-. This is a cognate of Old Saxon alo, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, Icelandic and Old Norse öl/øl, Finnish olut, Estonian õlu, Old Bulgarian olu cider, Slovenian ol, Old Prussian alu, Lithuanian alus, Latvian alus.","sort":"Beer","alcohol":"Yes","perc":4,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/ale.png"},{"id":14,"name":"allspice","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:34.499Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:34.499Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":"No","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/allspice.png"},{"id":15,"name":"almond extract","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:34.663Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:34.663Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":"No","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/almond extract.png"},{"id":16,"name":"almond flavoring","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:34.904Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:34.904Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":"No","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/almond flavoring.png"},{"id":17,"name":"almond","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:35.147Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:35.147Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":"No","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/almond.png"},{"id":18,"name":"amaretto","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:35.311Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:35.311Z","description":"Amaretto (Italian for \"a little bitter\") is a sweet, almond-flavoured, Italian liqueur associated with Saronno, Italy.

Amaretto is also commonly used in culinary applications.\r\n\r\nThe name amaretto originated as a diminutive of the Italian word amaro, meaning \"bitter\", which references the distinctive flavour lent by the mandorla amara (the bitter almond) or by the drupe kernel. However, the bitterness of amaretto tends to be mild, and sweeteners—and sometimes sweet almonds—enhance the flavour in the final products. Thus one can interpret the liqueur's name as a description of the taste as \"a little bitter\". Cyanide is processed out of the almond preparation prior to its use.\r\n\r\nConflation of amaro (\"bitter\") and amore (\"love\") has led to associations with romance.\r\n\r\nOne should not confuse amaretto with amaro, a different family of Italian liqueurs that, while also sweetened, have a stronger bitter flavour derived from herbs.","sort":"Liqueur","alcohol":"Yes","perc":28,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/amaretto.png"},{"id":19,"name":"angelica root","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:35.549Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:35.549Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":"No","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/angelica root.png"},{"id":20,"name":"angostura bitters","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:35.788Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:35.788Z","description":"Angostura bitters (English: /æŋɡəˈstjʊərə/) is a concentrated bitters, or botanically infused alcoholic mixture, made of water, 44.7% ethanol, gentian, herbs and spices by House of Angostura in Trinidad and Tobago. It is typically used for flavouring beverages or (less often) food. The bitters were first produced in the town of Angostura (Ciudad Bolívar, Venezuela) (hence the name), but do not contain angostura bark. The bottle is easily recognisable by its distinctive oversized label.\r\n\r\nThe recipe was developed as a tonic by a German, Johann Gottlieb Benjamin Siegert (1796–1870), surgeon general in Simón Bolívar's army in Venezuela. Siegert began to sell it in 1824 and established a distillery for the purpose in 1830. Siegert was based in the town of Angostura, now Ciudad Bolívar, and used locally available ingredients, perhaps aided by botanical knowledge of the local Amerindians. The product was sold abroad from 1853, and in 1875 the plant was moved from Ciudad Bolivar to Port of Spain, Trinidad, where it remains. Angostura won a medal at the Weltausstellung 1873 Wien. The medal is still depicted on the oversized label, along with reverse which shows Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria in profile.\r\n\r\nThe exact formula is a closely guarded secret, with only one person knowing the whole recipe, passed hereditarily.\r\n\r\nAngostura bitters are extremely concentrated and are an acquired taste; though 44.7% alcohol by volume, bitters are not normally ingested undiluted, but instead are used in small amounts as flavouring.\r\n\r\nAngostura bitters are a key ingredient in many cocktails. Originally used to help with upset stomachs of the soldiers in the Simón Bolívar army, it later became popular in soda water and was usually served with gin. The mix stuck in the form of a pink gin, and is also used in many other alcoholic cocktails such as long vodka, consisting of vodka, Angostura bitters, and lemonade. In the United States, it is best known for its use in whiskey cocktails: the Old Fashioned, made with whiskey, bitters, sugar, and water,[8] and the Manhattan, made usually with rye whiskey and sweet vermouth. In a Pisco Sour a few drops are sprinkled on top of the foam, both for aroma and decoration. In a Champagne Cocktail a few drops of bitters are added to a sugar cube.\r\n\r\nIn Hong Kong, Angostura bitters are included in the local Gunner cocktail. Though not in the classic recipe, bartenders sometimes add more flavour to the Mojito cocktail by sprinkling a few drops of Angostura bitters on top. Bitters can also be used in \"soft\" drinks; a common drink served in Australian and New Zealand pubs is lemon lime and bitters.\r\n\r\nAngostura Bitters Drink Guide, a promotional booklet of 1908, was reprinted in 2008 with a new introduction by Ross Bolton.","sort":"Bitter","alcohol":"No","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/angostura bitters.png"},{"id":21,"name":"anis","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:35.949Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:35.949Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":"No","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/anis.png"},{"id":22,"name":"anise","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:36.115Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:36.115Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":"No","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/anise.png"},{"id":23,"name":"anisette","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:36.365Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:36.365Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":"No","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/anisette.png"},{"id":24,"name":"aperol","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:36.604Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:36.604Z","description":null,"sort":"Liqueur","alcohol":"Yes","perc":11,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/aperol.png"},{"id":25,"name":"apfelkorn","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:37.208Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:37.208Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":"Yes","perc":18,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/apfelkorn.png"},{"id":26,"name":"apple brandy","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:37.440Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:37.440Z","description":null,"sort":"Brandy","alcohol":"Yes","perc":35,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/apple brandy.png"},{"id":27,"name":"apple cider","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:37.605Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:37.605Z","description":null,"sort":"Cider","alcohol":"Yes","perc":5,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/apple cider.png"},{"id":28,"name":"apple juice","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:37.775Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:37.775Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/apple juice.png"},{"id":29,"name":"apple schnapps","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:37.947Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:37.947Z","description":"Schnapps (/ʃnɑːps/ or /ʃnæps/) or schnaps is a type of alcoholic beverage that may take several forms, including distilled fruit brandies, herbal liqueurs, infusions, and \"flavored liqueurs\" made by adding fruit syrups, spices, or artificial flavorings to neutral grain spirits.\n\nThe English loanword \"schnapps\" is derived from the colloquial German word Schnaps [ʃnaps] (About this sound listen) (plural: Schnäpse) which is used in reference to spirit drinks.

The name derives from \"jacking\", a term for \"increasing\" (alcohol content) and specifically for \"freeze distilling\", the traditional method of producing the drink.\r\n\r\nIn colonial New Jersey, applejack was used as currency to pay road construction crews during the colonial period, leading to the slang name 'Jersey Lightning'. The oldest licensed applejack distillery in the United States, Laird \u0026 Company of Scobeyville, New Jersey, was until recently the country's only remaining producer of applejack.\r\n\r\nBecause freeze distillation is a low-infrastructure method of production compared to evaporative distillation, and doesn't, for example, require burning firewood to create heat, hard cider and applejack were historically easy to produce, though more expensive than grain alcohol, and hence were important drinks in the colonial era and the early years of the United States, particularly in cold northern areas without access to clean water.\r\n\r\nApplejack was historically made by concentrating cider through the traditional method of freeze distillation: The alcoholic fruit beer produced after the fall harvest was left outside during the winter. Periodically the frozen chunks of ice which had formed were removed, thus concentrating the unfrozen alcohol in the remaining liquid. Starting with the fermented juice, with an alcohol content of less than ten percent, the concentrated result can contain 25-40% alcohol.\r\n\r\nWhen commercial production began, applejack was also starting to be produced through evaporative distillation. Modern commercially produced applejack is no longer produced by jacking but rather by blending apple brandy and neutral spirits.","sort":"Beverage","alcohol":"Yes","perc":40,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/applejack.png"},{"id":32,"name":"apricot brandy","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:38.616Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:38.616Z","description":null,"sort":"Brandy","alcohol":"Yes","perc":24,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/apricot brandy.png"},{"id":33,"name":"apricot nectar","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:38.773Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:38.773Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/apricot nectar.png"},{"id":34,"name":"apricot","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:38.941Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:38.941Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/apricot.png"},{"id":35,"name":"aquavit","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:39.102Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:39.102Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/aquavit.png"},{"id":36,"name":"asafoetida","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:39.264Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:39.264Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/asafoetida.png"},{"id":37,"name":"añejo rum","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:39.500Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:39.500Z","description":"Rum is a distilled alcoholic beverage made from sugarcane byproducts, such as molasses, or directly from sugarcane juice, by a process of fermentation and distillation.

This beverage has famous associations with the Royal Navy (where it was mixed with water or beer to make grog) and piracy (where it was consumed as bumbo).

The trademark is currently owned by Diageo. It has a declared alcohol content of 17% by volume.\r\n\r\nBaileys Irish Cream was created by Gilbeys of Ireland, a division of International Distillers \u0026 Vintners, as it searched for something to introduce to the international market. The process of finding a product began in 1971 and it was introduced in 1974 as the first Irish cream on the market. The Baileys name was granted permission by John Chesterman after Gilbeys asked to use the name from a restaurant that John Chesterman owned. The fictional R.A. Bailey signature was inspired by the Bailey's Hotel in London, though the registered trademark omits the apostrophe. Baileys is produced in Dublin and Mallusk (Northern Ireland).\r\n\r\nCream and Irish whiskey from various distilleries are homogenized to form an emulsion with the aid of an emulsifier containing refined vegetable oil. The process prevents separation of the alcohol and cream during storage. The quantity of other ingredients is not known but they include herbs and sugar.\r\n\r\nAccording to the manufacturer, no preservatives are required as the alcohol content preserves the cream. The cream used in the drink comes from Glanbia, an Irish dairy company. Glanbia's Virginia facility in County Cavan produces a range of fat-filled milk powders and fresh cream. It has been the principal cream supplier to Baileys Irish Cream Liqueurs for more than thirty years.

During the brewing process, fermentation of the starch sugars in the wort produces ethanol and carbonation in the resulting beer. Most modern beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilizing agent. Other flavouring agents such as gruit, herbs, or fruits may be included or used instead of hops. In commercial brewing, the natural carbonation effect is often removed during processing and replaced with forced carbonation.\r\n\r\nSome of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and \"The Hymn to Ninkasi\", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people.\r\n\r\nBeer is distributed in bottles and cans and is also commonly available on draught, particularly in pubs and bars. The brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries. The strength of modern beer is usually around 4% to 6% alcohol by volume (abv), although it may vary between 0.5% and 20%, with some breweries creating examples of 40% abv and above.[11] Beer forms part of the culture of many nations and is associated with social traditions such as beer festivals as well as a rich pub culture involving activities like pub crawling and pub games such as bar billiards.\r\n\r\nVarious legal definitions of beer exist in different countries. Historically, the most famous of these was the Reinheitsgebot, which applied to parts of the Holy Roman Empire and Germany and required beer to be made from only water, hops, and barley. Today in Canada, the Canadian Government’s Food and Drug Regulations state that beer must have alcohol content that ranges from 1.1% to 8.6%, though it also includes a stipulation that it could be greater than 8.6% and labeled accordingly. Beer in South Korea must have less than 25% ABV, which means that it has to be 25 mL of alcohol or less per 100 mL of solution and can be considered ‘lite’ only if it has less than 30 kcal per 100ml. Additionally, beer in South Korea must use only water, hops, and starches (wheat, rice, barley, corn, or potato) as ingredients in the brewing process.[13] In Singapore, beer must have at minimum 1.0% alcohol by volume concentration at 20 °C. It is often brewed from a mixture of grains like malt, sugars or its equivalent, and hops or other vegetables.","sort":"Beer","alcohol":"Yes","perc":4,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/beer.png"},{"id":49,"name":"benedictine","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:42.215Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:42.215Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/benedictine.png"},{"id":50,"name":"berries","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:42.374Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:42.374Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/berries.png"},{"id":51,"name":"bitter lemon","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:42.533Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:42.533Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/bitter lemon.png"},{"id":52,"name":"bitters","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:42.703Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:42.703Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/bitters.png"},{"id":53,"name":"black pepper","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:42.868Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:42.868Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/black pepper.png"},{"id":54,"name":"black rum","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:43.025Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:43.025Z","description":null,"sort":"Rum","alcohol":"Yes","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/black rum.png"},{"id":55,"name":"black sambuca","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:43.266Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:43.266Z","description":null,"sort":"Sambuca","alcohol":"Yes","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/black sambuca.png"},{"id":56,"name":"blackberries","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:43.426Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:43.426Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/blackberries.png"},{"id":57,"name":"blackberry brandy","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:43.584Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:43.584Z","description":null,"sort":"Brandy","alcohol":"Yes","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/blackberry brandy.png"},{"id":58,"name":"blackberry schnapps","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:43.756Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:43.756Z","description":"Schnapps (/ʃnɑːps/ or /ʃnæps/) or schnaps is a type of alcoholic beverage that may take several forms, including distilled fruit brandies, herbal liqueurs, infusions, and \"flavored liqueurs\" made by adding fruit syrups, spices, or artificial flavorings to neutral grain spirits.\n\nThe English loanword \"schnapps\" is derived from the colloquial German word Schnaps [ʃnaps] (About this sound listen) (plural: Schnäpse) which is used in reference to spirit drinks.

Laraha is a bitter orange native of Curaçao with the Latin name: \"Citrus Aurantium Currasuviensis\", meaning \"Golden Orange of Curaçao\". Spanish explorers brought the sweet Valencia orange to the island in 1527, [2] but the nutrient-poor soil and arid climate of Curaçao proved unsuitable to Valencia cultivation, resulting in small, bitter fruit. Although the bitter flesh of the Laraha is hardly edible, the peels are aromatic and flavorful, maintaining much of the essence of the Valencia orange.\r\n\r\nThere are no definite facts that points out who and when the first Curaçao Liqueur was developed. The Lucas Bols distillery, founded in 1575 in Amsterdam, maintains that Lucas Bols (1652–1719) already developed a Laraha-based liqueur. The Dutch West Indies Company had taken possession of Curaçao in 1634 and Bols had shares in both the West and East India Companies to guarantee the cheap supply of spices for their distilled drinks. After the discovery that an aromatic oil could be extracted from the unripe peel of the otherwise useless bitter oranges, Bols had this oil exported back to Amsterdam to develop a liqueur similar to current day Curaçao. Bols tended to add an \"element of alchemical mystery\" to his products, explaining the unlikely addition of a blue coloring. In the past, the liqueur also had the name Crème de Ciel (\"cream of heaven\"), presumably for its blue color.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the Senior \u0026 Co, a company that originates from Curaçao, are to this day the only company that always produced their liqueur with the peels of the Laraha. The Jewish family, Senior and Chumacairo, started selling their liqueur in 1896 in their pharmacy at small quantities. In 1947 they bought the Landhuis (Dutch for \"country manor\") Chobolobo in Willemstad, where the distillery has since been housed. As this company is the only one who uses laraha fruit from Curaçao, it has been permitted to put the word \"genuine\" on its labels.","sort":"Liqueur","alcohol":"Yes","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/blue curacao.png"},{"id":64,"name":"blue maui","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:44.766Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:44.766Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/blue maui.png"},{"id":65,"name":"blueberries","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:44.931Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:44.931Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/blueberries.png"},{"id":66,"name":"blueberry schnapps","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:45.091Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:45.091Z","description":"Schnapps (/ʃnɑːps/ or /ʃnæps/) or schnaps is a type of alcoholic beverage that may take several forms, including distilled fruit brandies, herbal liqueurs, infusions, and \"flavored liqueurs\" made by adding fruit syrups, spices, or artificial flavorings to neutral grain spirits.\n\nThe English loanword \"schnapps\" is derived from the colloquial German word Schnaps [ʃnaps] (About this sound listen) (plural: Schnäpse) which is used in reference to spirit drinks.

The name is derived from the French Bourbon dynasty, although it is unclear precisely what inspired the whiskey's name (contenders include Bourbon County in Kentucky and Bourbon Street in New Orleans). Bourbon has been distilled since the 18th century. The use of the term \"bourbon\" for the whiskey has been traced to the 1820s, and the term began to be used consistently in Kentucky in the 1870s. While bourbon may be made anywhere in the United States, it is strongly associated with the American South, and with Kentucky in particular. As of 2014, the distillers' wholesale market revenue for bourbon sold within the U.S. is about $2.7 billion, and bourbon makes up about two-thirds of the $1.6 billion of U.S. exports of distilled spirits.\r\n\r\nThe origin of bourbon is not well documented. There are many conflicting legends and claims, some more credible than others. For example, the invention of bourbon is often attributed to Elijah Craig, a Baptist minister and distiller credited with many Kentucky firsts (e.g., fulling mill, paper mill, ropewalk) who is also said to have been the first to age the product in charred oak casks, a process which gives bourbon its reddish color and distinctive taste. Across the county line in Bourbon County, an early distiller named Jacob Spears is credited with being the first to label his product as Bourbon whiskey. Spears' home, Stone Castle, warehouse and spring house survive; one can drive by the Spears' home on Clay-Kiser Road.\r\n\r\nAlthough still popular and often repeated, the Craig legend is apocryphal. Similarly, the Spears story is a local favorite, rarely repeated outside the county. There likely was no single \"inventor\" of bourbon, which developed into its present form only in the late 19th century. Essentially any type of grain can be used to make whiskey, and the practice of aging whiskey and charring the barrels for better flavor had also been known in Europe for centuries. The late date of the Bourbon County etymology has led Louisville historian Michael Veach to dispute its authenticity. He proposes that the whiskey was named after Bourbon Street in New Orleans, a major port where shipments of Kentucky whiskey sold well as a cheaper alternative to French cognac.\r\n\r\nDistilling probably was brought to present-day Kentucky in the late 18th century by Scots, Scots-Irish, and other settlers (including English, Irish, Welsh, German and French) who began to farm the area in earnest. The spirit they made evolved, and became known as bourbon in the early 19th century due to its historical association with the geographic area known as Old Bourbon (this consisted of the original Bourbon County of Virginia as organized in 1785, a region that included much of today's Eastern Kentucky – including 34 of today's counties in Kentucky). This area included the current Bourbon County of Kentucky, which became a county of Kentucky when Kentucky was separated from Virginia as a new state in 1792.\r\n\r\nWhen American pioneers pushed west of the Allegheny Mountains following the American Revolution, the first counties they founded covered vast regions. One of these original, huge counties was Bourbon, established in 1785 and named after the French royal family. While this vast county was being carved into many smaller ones, early in the 19th century, many people continued to call the region Old Bourbon. Located within Old Bourbon was the principal port on the Ohio River, Maysville, Kentucky, from which whiskey and other products were shipped. \"Old Bourbon\" was stencilled on the barrels to indicate their port of origin. Old Bourbon whiskey was different because it was the first corn whiskey most people had ever tasted. In time, bourbon became the name for any corn-based whiskey.\r\n\r\nAlthough many distilleries operated in Bourbon County historically, there were no distilleries operating there between 1919, when Prohibition began in Kentucky, and late 2014, when a small distillery opened – a period of 95 years.\r\n\r\nA refinement often dubiously credited to James C. Crow was the sour mash process, by which each new fermentation is conditioned with some amount of spent mash. Spent mash is also known as spent beer, distillers' spent grain, stillage, and slop or feed mash, so named because it is used as animal feed. The acid introduced by using the sour mash controls the growth of bacteria that could taint the whiskey and creates a proper pH balance for the yeast to work.\r\n\r\nA concurrent resolution adopted by the United States Congress in 1964 declared bourbon to be a \"distinctive product of the United States\" and asked \"the appropriate agencies of the United States Government... [to] take appropriate action to prohibit importation into the United States of whiskey designated as 'Bourbon Whiskey.'\" Federal regulation now defines \"bourbon whiskey\" to only include \"bourbon\" produced in the United States.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, bourbon and Tennessee whiskey (which is sometimes regarded as a different type of spirit but which generally meets the legal requirements for being called bourbon) have enjoyed significant growth and popularity. The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, the industry trade group, tracks sales of bourbon and Tennessee whiskey together.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Distilled Spirits Council, during 2009–14, the volume of 9-liter cases of whiskey increased by 28.5% overall. Higher-end bourbon and whiskeys experienced the greatest growth: during 2009–14 the volume of the value segment increased by 12.1%, premium by 25.8%, high-end premium by 27.8% and super-premium by 123.8%. Gross supplier revenues (including federal excise tax) for U.S. bourbon and Tennessee whiskey increased by 46.7% over the 2009–14 period, with the greatest growth coming from high-end products (18.7% growth for value, 33.6% for premium, 44.5% for high-end premium, and 137.2% for super-premium).[4] In 2014, more than 19 million nine-liter cases of bourbon and Tennessee whiskey were sold in the U.S., generating almost $2.7 billion in wholesale distillery revenue. U.S. exports of bourbon whiskey surpassed $1 billion for the first time in 2013; distillers hailed the rise of a \"golden age of Kentucky bourbon\" and predicted further growth. In 2014, it was estimated that U.S. bourbon whiskey exports surpassed $1 billion (making up the majority of the U.S. total of $1.6 billion in spirits exports). Major export markets for U.S. spirits are, in descending order: Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia and France. The largest percentage increases in U.S. exports were, in descending order: Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Bahamas, Israel and United Arab Emirates. Key elements of growth in the markets showing the largest increases have been changes of law, trade agreements, and reductions of tariffs, as well as increased consumer demand for premium-category spirits.","sort":"Whiskey","alcohol":"Yes","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/bourbon.png"},{"id":68,"name":"brandy","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:45.734Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:45.734Z","description":"Brandy is a spirit produced by distilling wine. Brandy generally contains 35–60% alcohol by volume (70–120 US proof) and is typically taken as an after-dinner drink. Some brandies are aged in wooden casks, some are coloured with caramel colouring to imitate the effect of aging, and some brandies are produced using a combination of both aging and colouring.\r\n\r\nIn broader sense, the term \"brandy\" also denotes liquors obtained from distillation of pomace (pomace brandy) or mash or wine of any other fruit (fruit brandy). These products are also named eaux-de-vie.\r\n\r\nVarieties of wine brandy can be found across the winemaking world. Among the most renowned are Cognac and Armagnac from southwestern France.\r\n\r\nThe origins of brandy were clearly tied to the development of distillation. While the process was known in classical times, it wasn't used for significant beverage production until the 15th century.\r\n\r\nInitially wine was distilled as a preservation method and as a way to make it easier for merchants to transport. It is also thought that wine was originally distilled to lessen the tax which was assessed by volume. The intent was to add the water removed by distillation back to the brandy shortly before consumption. It was discovered that after having been stored in wooden casks, the resulting product had improved over the original distilled spirit. In addition to removing water, the distillation process led to the formation and decomposition of numerous aromatic compounds, fundamentally altering the composition of the distillate from its source. Non-volatile substances such as pigments, sugars, and salts remained behind in the still. As a result, the taste of the distillate was often quite unlike that of the original source.\r\n\r\nAs described in the 1728 edition of Cyclopaedia, the following method was used to distill brandy:\r\n\r\nA cucurbit was filled half full of the liquor from which brandy was to be drawn and then raised with a little fire until about one sixth part was distilled, or until that which falls into the receiver was entirely flammable. This liquor, distilled only once, was called spirit of wine or brandy. Purified by another distillation (or several more), this was then called spirit of wine rectified. The second distillation was made in balneo mariae and in a glass cucurbit, and the liquor was distilled to about one half the quantity. This was further rectified—as long as the operator thought necessary—to produce brandy.\r\n\r\nTo shorten these several distillations, which were long and troublesome, a chemical instrument was invented that reduced them to a single distillation. To test the purity of the rectified spirit of wine, a portion was ignited. If the entire contents were consumed by a fire without leaving any impurities behind, then the liquor was good. Another, better test involved putting a little gunpowder in the bottom of the spirit. If the gunpowder could ignite after the spirit was consumed by fire, then the liquor was good.\r\n\r\nAs most brandies have been distilled from grapes, the regions of the world producing excellent brandies have roughly paralleled those areas producing grapes for viniculture. At the end of the 19th century, the western European markets, including by extension their overseas empires, were dominated by French and Spanish brandies and eastern Europe was dominated by brandies from the Black Sea region, including Bulgaria, the Crimea, and Georgia. In 1884, David Sarajishvili founded his brandy factory in Tbilisi, Georgia, a crossroads for Turkish, Central Asian, and Persian trade routes and a part of the Russian Empire at the time. Armenian and Georgian brandies, called cognacs in the era, were considered some of the best in the world and often beat their French competitors at the International Expositions in Paris and Brussels in the early 1900s.[citation needed] The storehouses of the Romanov Court in St. Petersburg were regarded as the largest collections of cognacs and wines in the world with much of it from the Transcaucasus region of Georgia. During the October Revolution of 1917, upon the storming of the Winter Palace, the Bolshevik Revolution actually paused for a week or so as the participants gorged on the substantial stores of cognac and wines. The Russian market was always a huge brandy-consuming region in which home-grown varieties were common but much of it was imported. The patterns of bottles followed that of the western European norm. Throughout the Soviet era, the production of brandy was a source of pride for the communist regime as they continued to produce some excellent varieties, especially the most famous Jubilee Brandies of 1967, 1977, and 1987.[citation needed] Remaining bottles of these productions are highly sought after, not simply for their quality, but for their historical significance.","sort":"Spirit","alcohol":"Yes","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/brandy.png"},{"id":69,"name":"brown sugar","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:46.301Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:46.301Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/brown sugar.png"},{"id":70,"name":"butter","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:46.624Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:46.624Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/butter.png"},{"id":71,"name":"butterscotch schnapps","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:46.868Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:46.868Z","description":"Schnapps (/ʃnɑːps/ or /ʃnæps/) or schnaps is a type of alcoholic beverage that may take several forms, including distilled fruit brandies, herbal liqueurs, infusions, and \"flavored liqueurs\" made by adding fruit syrups, spices, or artificial flavorings to neutral grain spirits.\n\nThe English loanword \"schnapps\" is derived from the colloquial German word Schnaps [ʃnaps] (About this sound listen) (plural: Schnäpse) which is used in reference to spirit drinks.

Also known as aguardente, pinga, caninha and other names, it is the most popular distilled alcoholic beverage in Brazil. Outside Brazil, cachaça is used almost exclusively as an ingredient in tropical drinks, with the caipirinha being the most famous cocktail.\r\n\r\nSugar production was mostly switched from the Madeira islands to Brazil by the Portuguese in the 16th century. In Madeira, aguardente de cana is made by distilling sugar cane liquors and the pot stills from Madeira were brought to Brazil to make what today is also called cachaça.\r\n\r\nThe process dates from 1532, when one of the Portuguese colonisers brought the first cuttings of sugar cane to Brazil from Madeira. Cachaça is mostly produced in Brazil, where, according to 2007 figures, 1,500,000,000 litres (396,000,000 US gal; 330,000,000 imp gal) are consumed annually, compared with 15,000,000 litres (3,960,000 US gal; 3,300,000 imp gal) outside the country. It is typically between 38% and 48% alcohol by volume. When homemade, it can be as strong as the distiller wants. Up to six grams per litre of sugar may be added.\r\n\r\nFigures from 2003 indicate 1.3 billion litres of cachaça are produced each year; only 1% of this is exported (mainly to Germany).\r\n\r\nCachaça, like rum, has two varieties: unaged (Portuguese: branca, \"white\" or prata, \"silver\") and aged (amarela, \"yellow\" or ouro, \"gold\"). White cachaça is usually bottled immediately after distillation and tends to be cheaper (some producers age it for up to 12 months in wooden barrels to achieve a smoother blend). It is often used as an ingredient in caipirinha and other beverages. Dark cachaça, usually seen as the \"premium\" variety, is aged in wood barrels and is meant to be drunk straight (it is usually aged for up to 3 years though some \"ultra premium\" cachaças have been aged for up to 15 years). Its flavour is influenced by the type of wood the barrel is made from.\r\n\r\nThere are very important regions in Brazil where fine pot still cachaça is produced such as Chã Grande in Pernambuco state, Salinas in Minas Gerais state, Paraty in Rio de Janeiro state, Monte Alegre do Sul in São Paulo state and Abaíra in Bahia state. Nowadays, producers of cachaça can be found in most Brazilian regions and in 2011 there were over 40,000 of them.","sort":"Spirit","alcohol":"Yes","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/cachaca.png"},{"id":73,"name":"calvados","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:47.217Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:47.217Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/calvados.png"},{"id":74,"name":"campari","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:47.467Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:47.467Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/campari.png"},{"id":75,"name":"canadian whisky","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:47.633Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:47.633Z","description":null,"sort":"Whiskey","alcohol":"Yes","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/canadian whisky.png"},{"id":76,"name":"candy","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:47.990Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:47.990Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/candy.png"},{"id":77,"name":"cantaloupe","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:48.161Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:48.161Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/cantaloupe.png"},{"id":78,"name":"caramel coloring","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:48.327Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:48.327Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/caramel coloring.png"},{"id":79,"name":"carbonated soft drink","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:48.486Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:48.486Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/carbonated soft drink.png"},{"id":80,"name":"carbonated water","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:48.642Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:48.642Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/carbonated water.png"},{"id":81,"name":"cardamom","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:48.803Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:48.803Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/cardamom.png"},{"id":82,"name":"cayenne pepper","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:49.284Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:49.284Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/cayenne pepper.png"},{"id":83,"name":"celery salt","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:49.446Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:49.446Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/celery salt.png"},{"id":84,"name":"celery","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:49.605Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:49.605Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/celery.png"},{"id":85,"name":"chambord raspberry liqueur","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:49.768Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:49.768Z","description":"Chambord Liqueur (pronounced [ʃɑ̃.bɔʁ]) is a 16.5% abv raspberry liqueur modelled after a liqueur produced in the Loire Valley of France during the late 17th century. The Chambord product brand has been owned and produced by the Brown-Forman Corporation since 2006.\r\n\r\nChambord is made from red and black raspberries, Madagascar vanilla, Moroccan citrus peel, honey and cognac.\r\n\r\nThe Chambord brand was founded in 1982. The drink was inspired by raspberry liqueur made in the Loire Valley in the late 1600s, said to have been introduced to Louis XIV during one of his visits to the château de Chambord. It was common during that time for liqueurs and cognac to be consumed with elegant meals.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, the Chambord product brand was acquired by the Brown-Forman Corporation.\r\n\r\nChambord is produced in the Loire Valley from red and black raspberries, Madagascar vanilla, Moroccan citrus peel, honey and cognac. Whole raspberries and blackberries are steeped in French spirits for a period of several weeks to produce a fruit infusion.\r\n\r\nAfter the infusion is extracted, a second set of spirits is added to the fruit and allowed to rest for a few weeks. After this second infusion is drawn off, the remaining fruit is pressed to obtain the natural sugars and juice.

Some use the term Champagne as a generic term for sparkling wine, but in many countries, it is illegal to label any product Champagne unless it both comes from the Champagne region and is produced under the rules of the appellation.\r\n\r\nThe primary grapes used in the production of Champagne are black Pinot noir and Pinot Meunier but also white Chardonnay. Champagne appellation law only allows grapes grown according to appellation rules in specifically designated plots within the appellation to be used in the production of champagne.\r\n\r\nChampagne became associated with royalty in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. The leading manufacturers made efforts to associate their Champagnes with nobility and royalty through advertising and packaging, which led to popularity among the emerging middle class.","sort":"Wine","alcohol":"Yes","perc":13,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/champagne.png"},{"id":87,"name":"cherries","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:50.247Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:50.247Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/cherries.png"},{"id":88,"name":"cherry brandy","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:50.407Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:50.407Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/cherry brandy.png"},{"id":89,"name":"cherry cola","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:50.566Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:50.566Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/cherry cola.png"},{"id":90,"name":"cherry grenadine","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:50.730Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:50.730Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/cherry grenadine.png"},{"id":91,"name":"cherry heering","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:50.884Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:50.884Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/cherry heering.png"},{"id":92,"name":"cherry juice","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:51.046Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:51.046Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/cherry juice.png"},{"id":93,"name":"cherry liqueur","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:51.222Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:51.222Z","description":null,"sort":"Liqueur","alcohol":"Yes","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/cherry liqueur.png"},{"id":94,"name":"cherry","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:51.377Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:51.377Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/cherry.png"},{"id":95,"name":"chocolate ice-cream","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:52.331Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:52.331Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/chocolate ice-cream.png"},{"id":96,"name":"chocolate liqueur","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:52.496Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:52.496Z","description":null,"sort":"Liqueur","alcohol":"Yes","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/chocolate liqueur.png"},{"id":97,"name":"chocolate milk","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:52.650Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:52.650Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/chocolate milk.png"},{"id":98,"name":"chocolate syrup","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:52.809Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:52.809Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/chocolate syrup.png"},{"id":99,"name":"chocolate","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:52.955Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:52.955Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/chocolate.png"},{"id":100,"name":"cider","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:53.583Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:53.583Z","description":"Cider (/ˈsaɪdər/ SY-dər) is an alcoholic beverage made from the fermented juice of apples.\r\n\r\nThe juice of any variety of apple can be used to make cider, but cider apples are best. The addition of sugar or extra fruit before a second fermentation increases the ethanol content of the resulting beverage.\r\n\r\nCider is popular in the United Kingdom, especially in the West Country, and widely available. The UK has the world's highest per capita consumption, as well as its largest cider-producing companies. Cider is also popular in other European countries including Ireland, Portugal (mainly in Minho and Madeira), France (in particular Brittany and Normandy), northern Italy (Piedmont and Friuli), and Spain (especially Asturias and the Basque Country). Central Europe also has its own types of cider with Rhineland-Palatinate and Hesse producing a particularly tart version known as Apfelwein.\r\n\r\nCider alcohol content varies from 1.2% ABV to 8.5% or more in traditional English ciders, and 3.5% to 12% in continental ciders. In UK law, it must contain at least 35% apple juice (fresh or from concentrate), although CAMRA says that \"real cider\" must be at least 90% fresh apple juice. In the US, there is a 50% minimum. In France, cider must be made solely from apples. In 2014, a study found that a pint of mass-market cider contained five teaspoons (20.5 g) of sugar, nearly as much as the WHO recommends as an adult's daily allowance of added sugar, and 5–10 times the amount of sugar in lager or ale.\r\n\r\nPerry is a similar product made from fermented pear juice.\r\n\r\nThe flavour of cider varies. Ciders can be classified from dry to sweet. Their appearance ranges from cloudy with sediment to completely clear, and their colour ranges from almost clear to amber to brown. The variations in clarity and colour are mostly due to filtering between pressing and fermentation. Some apple varieties will produce a clear cider without any need for filtration. Both sparkling and still ciders are made; the sparkling variety is the more common.\r\n\r\nModern, mass-produced ciders closely resemble sparkling wine in appearance. More traditional brands tend to be darker and cloudier. They are often stronger than the mass-produced varieties and taste more strongly of apples. Almost colourless, white cider has the same apple juice content as conventional cider but is harder to create because the cider maker has to blend various apples to create a clearer liquid. White ciders tend to be sweeter and more refreshing. They are typically 7-8 % ABV in strength. Black cider, by contrast, is dry amber premium cider which has an alcohol content of 7-8 % ABV. The descriptor black usually comes after the brand name such as Union Black and Barnstormer Black.","sort":"Cider","alcohol":"Yes","perc":4,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/cider.png"},{"id":101,"name":"cinnamon schnapps","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:53.752Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:53.752Z","description":"Schnapps (/ʃnɑːps/ or /ʃnæps/) or schnaps is a type of alcoholic beverage that may take several forms, including distilled fruit brandies, herbal liqueurs, infusions, and \"flavored liqueurs\" made by adding fruit syrups, spices, or artificial flavorings to neutral grain spirits.\n\nThe English loanword \"schnapps\" is derived from the colloquial German word Schnaps [ʃnaps] (About this sound listen) (plural: Schnäpse) which is used in reference to spirit drinks.

Originally intended as a patent medicine, it was invented in the late 19th century by John Pemberton and was bought out by businessman Asa Griggs Candler, whose marketing tactics led Coca-Cola to its dominance of the world soft-drink market throughout the 20th century. The drink's name refers to two of its original ingredients, which were kola nuts (a source of caffeine) and coca leaves. The current formula of Coca-Cola remains a trade secret, although a variety of reported recipes and experimental recreations have been published.\r\n\r\nThe Coca-Cola Company produces concentrate, which is then sold to licensed Coca-Cola bottlers throughout the world. The bottlers, who hold exclusive territory contracts with the company, produce the finished product in cans and bottles from the concentrate, in combination with filtered water and sweeteners. A typical 12-US-fluid-ounce (350 ml) can contains 38 grams (1.3 oz) of sugar (usually in the form of high fructose corn syrup). The bottlers then sell, distribute, and merchandise Coca-Cola to retail stores, restaurants, and vending machines throughout the world. The Coca-Cola Company also sells concentrate for soda fountains of major restaurants and foodservice distributors.\r\n\r\nThe Coca-Cola Company has on occasion introduced other cola drinks under the Coke name. The most common of these is Diet Coke, along with others including Caffeine-Free Coca-Cola, Diet Coke Caffeine-Free, Coca-Cola Cherry, Coca-Cola Zero, Coca-Cola Vanilla, and special versions with lemon, lime, and coffee. Based on Interbrand's \"best global brand\" study of 2015, Coca-Cola was the world's third most valuable brand, after Apple and Google. In 2013, Coke products were sold in over 200 countries worldwide, with consumers downing more than 1.8 billion company beverage servings each day.","sort":"Soft Drink","alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/coca-cola.png"},{"id":108,"name":"cocktail onion","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:55.226Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:55.226Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/cocktail onion.png"},{"id":109,"name":"cocoa powder","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:55.392Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:55.392Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/cocoa powder.png"},{"id":110,"name":"coconut cream","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:55.553Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:55.553Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/coconut cream.png"},{"id":111,"name":"coconut liqueur","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:55.720Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:55.720Z","description":null,"sort":"Liqueur","alcohol":"Yes","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/coconut liqueur.png"},{"id":112,"name":"coconut milk","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:55.878Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:55.878Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/coconut milk.png"},{"id":113,"name":"coconut rum","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:56.034Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:56.034Z","description":null,"sort":"Rum","alcohol":"Yes","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/coconut rum.png"},{"id":114,"name":"coconut syrup","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:56.202Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:56.202Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/coconut syrup.png"},{"id":115,"name":"coffee brandy","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:56.362Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:56.362Z","description":null,"sort":"Brandy","alcohol":"Yes","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/coffee brandy.png"},{"id":116,"name":"coffee liqueur","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:56.522Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:56.522Z","description":null,"sort":"Liqueur","alcohol":"Yes","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/coffee liqueur.png"},{"id":117,"name":"coffee","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:56.687Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:56.687Z","description":"Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, which are the seeds of berries from the Coffea plant. The genus Coffea is native to tropical Africa (specifically having its origin in Ethiopia and Sudan) and Madagascar, the Comoros, Mauritius, and Réunion in the Indian Ocean. The plant was exported from Africa to countries around the world and coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, India, and Africa. The two most commonly grown are the highly regarded arabica, and the less sophisticated but stronger and more hardy robusta. Once ripe, coffee berries are picked, processed, and dried. Dried coffee seeds (referred to as beans) are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground and brewed with near-boiling water to produce coffee as a beverage.\r\n\r\nCoffee is slightly acidic and can have a stimulating effect on humans because of its caffeine content. Coffee is one of the most popular drinks in the world. It can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, cafe latte, etc.). It is usually served hot, although iced coffee is also served. Clinical studies indicate that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial in healthy adults, with continuing research on whether long-term consumption inhibits cognitive decline during aging or lowers the risk of some forms of cancer.\r\n\r\nThe earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking appears in the middle of the 15th century in the Sufi shrines of Yemen. It was here in Arabia that coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a similar way to how it is now prepared. Coffee seeds were first exported from East Africa to Yemen, as the coffea arabica plant is thought to have been indigenous to the former. Yemeni traders took coffee back to their homeland and began to cultivate the seed. By the 16th century, it had reached Persia, Turkey, and North Africa. From there, it spread to Europe and the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nCoffee is a major export commodity: it is the top agricultural export for numerous countries and is among the world's largest legal agricultural exports. It is one of the most valuable commodities exported by developing countries. Green (unroasted) coffee is one of the most traded agricultural commodities in the world. Some controversy is associated with coffee cultivation and the way developed countries trade with developing nations and the impact of its cultivation on the environment, in regards to clearing of land for coffee-growing and water use. Consequently, the markets for fair trade coffee and organic coffee are expanding.","sort":"Coffee","alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/coffee.png"},{"id":118,"name":"cognac","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:57.019Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:57.019Z","description":"Cognac (/ˈkɒnjæk/ KON-yak or /ˈkoʊnjæk/ KOHN-yak; French pronunciation: ​[kɔ.ɲak]) is a variety of brandy named after the town of Cognac, France.

The term, used on its own, usually refers to a sweetened version.\r\n\r\nA cup of standard 100% cranberry juice, amounting to 248 grams or 8 ounces, is a rich source of antioxidants, vitamin C and salicylic acid. It also supplies calcium, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, and potassium minerals. Cranberry juice is classified as an acidic drink with a typical pH between 2.3 and 2.5.\r\n\r\nIn 2010 a study conducted by the Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts found that the ingredients in cranberry juice limit the ability of E. coli bacteria (the main cause of UTIs) to cling to other bacteria. Without other bacteria, E. coli's ability to grow and reproduce is limited. The researchers concluded that cranberry juice helps prevent UTIs, but stopped short of saying the juice cures them. According to WebMD, which reported on the study, study researcher Terri Anne Camesano said people should not self-treat urinary tract infections, and anyone who suspects they have an infection should see a doctor, but drinking cranberry juice may be an easy, inexpensive way to help keep E. coli at bay.\r\n\r\nThere is some evidence that although long-term use of cranberry juice can help prevent symptomatic urinary tract infections, people do not persist in taking it over long periods.[4] There is no significant difference between cranberry juices and capsules. It is thought to prevent adhesion of bacteria such as E. coli to the urinary tract, by inducing changes to their fimbriae.\r\n\r\nThe proanthocyanidins found in cranberry juice can prevent bacteria from adhering to the epithelial tissue that line many interior parts of the human body. These adhering bacteria can cause breakdown and inflammation of the epithelial lining of the urinary tract, leading to urinary tract infections.\r\n","sort":"Juice","alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/cranberry juice.png"},{"id":129,"name":"cranberry liqueur","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:59.653Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:59.653Z","description":null,"sort":"Liqueur","alcohol":"Yes","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/cranberry liqueur.png"},{"id":130,"name":"cranberry vodka","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:59.816Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:59.816Z","description":null,"sort":"Vodka","alcohol":"Yes","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/cranberry vodka.png"},{"id":131,"name":"cream of coconut","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:59.982Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:43:59.982Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/cream of coconut.png"},{"id":132,"name":"cream sherry","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:00.140Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:00.140Z","description":null,"sort":"Sherry","alcohol":"Yes","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/cream sherry.png"},{"id":133,"name":"cream soda","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:00.302Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:00.302Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/cream soda.png"},{"id":134,"name":"cream","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:00.469Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:00.469Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/cream.png"},{"id":135,"name":"creme de almond","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:00.632Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:00.632Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/creme de almond.png"},{"id":136,"name":"creme de banane","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:00.792Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:00.792Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/creme de banane.png"},{"id":137,"name":"creme de cacao","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:00.955Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:00.955Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/creme de cacao.png"},{"id":138,"name":"creme de cassis","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:01.121Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:01.121Z","description":"Crème de cassis is a sweet, dark red liqueur made from blackcurrants.

The brand had been owned by the MacKinnon family for a hundred years but was bought by William Grant \u0026 Sons in 2014. It has been produced under contract at the Morrison Bowmore Distillers facility at Springburn Bond, Glasgow since 2010.\r\n\r\nThe name \"Drambuie\" possibly derives from a contraction of the Scottish Gaelic phrase an dram buidheach – \"the drink that satisfies\" – a claim made by the original manufacturers of the drink.\r\n\r\nAfter the Battle of Culloden in 1746, Prince Charles Edward Stuart fled to the isle of Skye. There, he was given sanctuary by Captain John MacKinnon of Clan MacKinnon. According to family legend, after staying with the captain, the prince rewarded him with this prized drink recipe. This version of events is disputed by historians who believe it to be a story concocted to boost sales of the drink.\r\n\r\nThe legend holds that the recipe, which at that time had no known name, was given by Clan MacKinnon to John Ross in the late 19th century. James Ross, his son and a local business man, ran the Broadford Hotel in Broadford on Skye and it was he who, after the death of John in 1879, began to experiment with the recipe at the Hotel.\r\n\r\nDrambuie is a sweet, golden coloured 40% ABV liqueur made from Scotch whisky, honey, herbs and spices.\r\n\r\nIn the 1880s, Ross developed and improved the recipe, changing the original brandy base to one of scotch whisky, initially for his friends and then later for hotel patrons. Ross named the concoction 'Drambuie' and sold it further afield, eventually reaching markets in France and the United States. As the drink became better known, Ross registered the name as a trademark in 1893.\r\n\r\nWhen Ross died, his widow, Eleanor, was obliged to sell the recipe to pay for their children's education; by coincidence to a different MacKinnon family. The latter MacKinnon family produced the drink until 2014, when the company was sold.","sort":"Liqueur","alcohol":"Yes","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/drambuie.png"},{"id":156,"name":"dried oregano","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:04.899Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:04.899Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/dried oregano.png"},{"id":157,"name":"dry vermouth","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:05.054Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:05.054Z","description":"Vermouth (/vərˈmuːθ/ ver-MOOTH; also UK: /ˈvɜːrməθ/;) is an aromatized, fortified wine flavored with various botanicals (roots, barks, flowers, seeds, herbs, and spices).\r\n\r\nThe modern versions of the beverage were first produced in the mid to late 18th century in Turin, Italy. While vermouth was traditionally used for medicinal purposes, its true claim to fame is as an aperitif, with fashionable cafes in Turin serving it to guests around the clock. However, in the late 19th century it became popular with bartenders as a key ingredient in many classic cocktails that have survived to date, such as the Martini, the Manhattan, the Rob Roy, and the Negroni. In addition to being consumed as an aperitif or cocktail ingredient, vermouth is sometimes used as an alternative white wine in cooking.\r\n\r\nHistorically, there have been two main types of vermouth: sweet and dry. Responding to demand and competition, vermouth manufacturers have created additional styles, including extra-dry white, sweet white (bianco), red, amber (ambre or rosso), and rosé. Vermouth is produced by starting with a base of a neutral grape wine or unfermented wine must. Each manufacturer adds additional alcohol and a proprietary mixture of dry ingredients, consisting of aromatic herbs, roots, and barks, to the base wine, base wine plus spirit or spirit only – which may be redistilled before adding to the wine or unfermented wine must. After the wine is aromatized and fortified, the vermouth is sweetened with either cane sugar or caramelized sugar, depending on the style. Italian and French companies produce most of the vermouth consumed throughout the world, although the United States and the United Kingdom are also producers.","sort":"Fortified Wine","alcohol":"Yes","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/dry vermouth.png"},{"id":158,"name":"dubonnet blanc","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:05.217Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:05.217Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/dubonnet blanc.png"},{"id":159,"name":"dubonnet rouge","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:05.381Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:05.381Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/dubonnet rouge.png"},{"id":160,"name":"egg white","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:05.627Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:05.627Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/egg white.png"},{"id":161,"name":"egg yolk","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:05.794Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:05.794Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/egg yolk.png"},{"id":162,"name":"egg","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:05.954Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:05.954Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/egg.png"},{"id":163,"name":"eggnog","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:06.105Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:06.105Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/eggnog.png"},{"id":164,"name":"erin cream","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:06.722Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:06.722Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/erin cream.png"},{"id":165,"name":"espresso","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:06.887Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:06.887Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/espresso.png"},{"id":166,"name":"everclear","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:07.053Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:07.053Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/everclear.png"},{"id":167,"name":"fanta","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:07.556Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:07.556Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/fanta.png"},{"id":168,"name":"fennel seeds","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:07.889Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:07.889Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/fennel seeds.png"},{"id":169,"name":"firewater","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:08.219Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:08.219Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/firewater.png"},{"id":170,"name":"flaked almonds","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:08.379Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:08.379Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/flaked almonds.png"},{"id":171,"name":"food coloring","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:08.708Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:08.708Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/food coloring.png"},{"id":172,"name":"forbidden fruit","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:08.873Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:08.873Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/forbidden fruit.png"},{"id":173,"name":"frangelico","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:09.041Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:09.041Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/frangelico.png"},{"id":174,"name":"fresca","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:09.505Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:09.505Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/fresca.png"},{"id":175,"name":"fresh basil","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:09.682Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:09.682Z","description":null,"sort":"Spice","alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/fresh basil.png"},{"id":176,"name":"fresh lemon juice","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:09.848Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:09.848Z","description":"The lemon, Citrus limon (L.)

Galliano uses vanillin for flavouring and sugar and glucose syrup for sweetening. Caramel and tartrazine are used to achieve Galliano's bright yellow colour. Neutral alcohol is infused with the pressings from the herbs except for the vanilla. The liquid is distilled and then infused with separately pressed vanilla. In the final stage, distilled water, refined sugar and pure neutral alcohol are blended with the base. Galliano has been formulated at both 60 proof (30% by volume) and 84.6 proof (42.3% by volume).\r\n\r\nGalliano is sweet with vanilla-anise flavour and subtle citrus and woodsy herbal undernotes. The vanilla top note differentiates Galliano from other anise-flavoured liqueurs such as Sambuca, Pernod, or Anisette. It is used both as a digestivo (meant for drinking after heavy meals), and as an ingredient for cocktails, most notably the Harvey Wallbanger, Yellow Bird (cocktail), Golden Cadillac, and Golden Dream.\r\n\r\nThe Galliano brand is currently owned by Dutch distiller Lucas Bols, and marketed through its worldwide distribution joint venture, Maxxium. Galliano is packaged in a distinctively shaped bottle, reminiscent of a classical Roman column. Several other liqueurs are also produced under the Galliano brand name, including a black Sambuca, a white Sambuca and an amaretto, which are predominantly distributed in Australasia,[3] where the products are popular as shots. Galliano also makes Galliano Ristretto coffee-flavored liqueur and Galliano Balsamico, a balsamic vinegar-infused liqueur. Both Galliano Autentico and Galliano Vanilla, as used in the Harvey Wallbanger, are available.","sort":"Liqueur","alcohol":"Yes","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/galliano.png"},{"id":181,"name":"garlic sauce","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:10.987Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:10.987Z","description":null,"sort":"Sauce","alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/garlic sauce.png"},{"id":182,"name":"gatorade","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:11.294Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:11.294Z","description":"The Gatorade Company, Inc. is an American manufacturer of sports-themed beverage and food products, built around its signature line of sports drinks. Gatorade is currently manufactured by PepsiCo and is distributed in over 80 countries. The beverage was first developed in 1965 by a team of researchers at the University of Florida to replenish the carbohydrates that the school's student-athletes burned and the combination of water and electrolytes that they lost in sweat during rigorous sport activities.\r\n\r\nOriginally produced and marketed by Stokely-Van Camp, the Gatorade brand was purchased by the Quaker Oats Company in 1987, which, in turn, was bought by PepsiCo in 2000.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Guinness ceased brewing cask-conditioned beers and developed a keg brewing system with aluminium kegs replacing the wooden casks; these were nicknamed \"iron lungs\". The production of Guinness, as with many beers, also involves the use of isinglass made from fish. Isinglass is used as a fining agent for settling out suspended matter in the vat.

In un-homogenized milk, the fat, which is less dense, will eventually rise to the top. In the industrial production of cream, this process is accelerated by using centrifuges called \"separators\". In many countries, cream is sold in several grades depending on the total butterfat content. Cream can be dried to a powder for shipment to distant markets. Cream has high levels of saturated fat.\r\n\r\nCream skimmed from milk may be called \"sweet cream\" to distinguish it from whey cream skimmed from whey, a by-product of cheese-making. Whey cream has a lower fat content and tastes more salty, tangy and \"cheesy\".[3] In many countries, cream is usually sold partially fermented: sour cream, crème fraîche, and so on.\r\n\r\nCream has many culinary uses in sweet, bitter, salty and tangy dishes.\r\n\r\nCream produced by cattle (particularly Jersey cattle) grazing on natural pasture often contains some natural carotenoid pigments derived from the plants they eat; this gives the cream a slight yellow tone, hence the name of the yellowish-white color, cream.

It is produced in Lynchburg, Tennessee, by the Jack Daniel Distillery, which has been owned by the Brown-Forman Corporation since 1956. Despite being the location of a major operational distillery, Jack Daniel's home county of Moore is a dry county, so the product is not available for purchase at stores or restaurants within the county.\r\n\r\nThe product meets the regulatory criteria for classification as a straight bourbon, though the company disavows this classification and markets it simply as Tennessee whiskey rather than as Tennessee bourbon. Jack Daniel's distillery tour advises that their product is initially bourbon prior to entering their charcoal filtering setup, and that this process creates the distinction between regular bourbon and \"Tennessee sipping whiskey.\" As defined in the North American Free Trade Agreement, Tennessee Whiskey is classified as a straight bourbon authorized to be produced in the state of Tennessee. Packaged in square bottles, a total of 11 million cases of the flagship \"Black Label\" product were sold in the company's 2012 fiscal year, which ended April 30, 2013.\r\n\r\nThe mash for Jack Daniel's is made from corn, rye, and malted barley, and is distilled in copper stills. It is then filtered through 10-foot (3.0 m) stacks of sugar maple charcoal. The company refers to this filtering step as \"mellowing\". This extra step, known as the Lincoln County Process, removes impurities and the taste of corn. The company argues this extra step makes the product different from bourbon. However, Tennessee whiskey is required to be \"a straight Bourbon Whiskey\" under terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement and Canadian law. A distinctive aspect of the filtering process is that the Jack Daniel's brand grinds its charcoal before using it for filtering. After the filtering, the whiskey is stored in newly handcrafted oak barrels, which give the whiskey its color and most of its flavor.\r\n\r\nThe product label mentions that it is a \"sour mash\" whiskey, which means that when the mash is prepared, some of the wet solids from a previously used batch are mixed in to help make the fermentation process operate more consistently. This is common practice in American whiskey production. (As of 2005, all currently produced straight bourbon is produced using the sour mash process.)\r\n\r\nAfter being used for the aging of Jack Daniel's whiskey, many barrels go to Scotland to be used in the production of Scotch whisky. Some barrels are leased from Glenmorangie distillery. Some of the barrels are sold to McIlhenny Company of Avery Island, Louisiana, for production of Tabasco sauce and to both the Mount Gay Rum company of Barbados and Appleton Estate of Jamaica for use in the aging process of their distinctively flavored rums.] Some barrels are also cut in half and shipped to Lowe's Home Centers to be used as planter pots. They retain the whiskey smell for some time after arriving there and must be watered every couple of days to keep them intact[clarification needed] before they are sold and filled with soil.","sort":"Whiskey","alcohol":"Yes","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/jack daniels.png"},{"id":223,"name":"jello","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:19.663Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:19.663Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/jello.png"},{"id":224,"name":"jelly","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:19.829Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:19.829Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/jelly.png"},{"id":225,"name":"jagermeister","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:19.991Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:19.991Z","description":"Jägermeister (/ˈjeɪɡərˌmaɪstər/, YAY-gər-my-stər, German: [ˈjɛːɡɐˌmaɪstɐ], stylized Jägermeiſter) is a digestif made with 56 herbs and spices at a strength of 35% alcohol by volume (61 degrees proof, or US 70 proof).

Kahlúa was Hispanicized as Ulúa, forming the name of the modern San Juan de Ulúa fortress.\r\n\r\nThe company merged in 1994 with Allied Lyons to become Allied Domecq. In turn, that company was partially acquired in 2005 by Pernod Ricard, the largest spirits distributor in the world since its merger with the Swedish Vin \u0026 Sprit in March 2008.\r\n\r\nSince 2004, the alcohol content of Kahlúa is 20.0%; earlier versions had 26.5%. In 2002, a more expensive, high-end product called \"Kahlúa Especial\" became available in the United States, Canada and Australia after previously being offered only in duty-free markets.

It is conditioned at low temperatures, normally at the brewery. It may be pale, golden, amber, or dark.\r\n\r\nAlthough one of the most defining features of lager is its maturation in cold storage, it is also distinguished by the use of a specific yeast. While it is possible to use lager yeast in a warm fermentation process, such as with American steam beer, the lack of a cold storage maturation phase precludes such beer from being classified as lager. On the other hand, German Altbier and Kölsch, brewed with a top-fermenting yeast at a warm temperature, but with a cold storage finishing stage, are classified as obergäriges Lagerbier (top-fermented lager beer).\r\n\r\nUntil the 19th century, the German word Lagerbier (de) referred to all types of \"bottom-fermented\", cool-conditioned beer, in normal strengths. In Germany today however, the term is mainly reserved for the prevalent lager beer styles of southern Germany, \"Helles\" (pale), or a \"Dunkel\" (dark). Pilsner, a more heavily hopped pale lager, is most often known as \"Pilsner\", \"Pilsener\", or \"Pils.\" Other lagers are Bock, Märzen, and Schwarzbier.\r\n\r\nIn the United Kingdom, the term lager commonly refers specifically to pale lagers, many of which are derived from the Pilsner style. Worldwide, pale lager is the most widely consumed and commercially available style of beer. It is often known primarily by its brand name, and labeled simply as \"beer\". Well-known brands include: Pilsner Urquell, Miller, Stella Artois, Beck's, Brahma, Budweiser Budvar, Corona, Snow, Tsingtao, Kirin Company, Heineken, Carling, Foster's, and Carlsberg.","sort":"Beer","alcohol":"Yes","perc":4,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/lager.png"},{"id":236,"name":"lemon juice","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:22.444Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:22.444Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/lemon juice.png"},{"id":237,"name":"lemon peel","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:22.618Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:22.618Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/lemon peel.png"},{"id":238,"name":"lemon soda","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:22.792Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:22.792Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/lemon soda.png"},{"id":239,"name":"lemon vodka","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:22.955Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:22.955Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/lemon vodka.png"},{"id":240,"name":"lemon-lime soda","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:23.138Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:23.138Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/lemon-lime soda.png"},{"id":null,"name":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/lemon-lime.png"},{"id":null,"name":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"description":"The lemon, Citrus limon (L.)

In 2013, following consumer research, Suntory reduced the sugar content and began producing Midori with a redesigned label and frosted glass bottle.","sort":"Liqueur","alcohol":"Yes","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/midori.png"},{"id":271,"name":"milk","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:29.318Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:29.318Z","description":"Milk is a white liquid produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for infant mammals (including humans who breastfeed) before they are able to digest other types of food. Early-lactation milk contains colostrum, which carries the mother's antibodies to its young and can reduce the risk of many diseases. It contains many other nutrients including protein and lactose.\r\n\r\nAs an agricultural product, milk is extracted from non-human mammals during or soon after pregnancy. Dairy farms produced about 730 million tonnes of milk in 2011, from 260 million dairy cows. India is the world's largest producer of milk, and is the leading exporter of skimmed milk powder, yet it exports few other milk products. The ever increasing rise in domestic demand for dairy products and a large demand-supply gap could lead to India being a net importer of dairy products in the future. The United States, India, China and Brazil are the world's largest exporters of milk and milk products. China and Russia were the world's largest importers of milk and milk products until 2016 when both countries became self-sufficient, contributing to a worldwide glut of milk.\r\n\r\nThroughout the world, there are more than six billion consumers of milk and milk products.

Many of the plants are aromatic in all parts and include widely used culinary herbs, such as basil, mint, rosemary, sage, savory, marjoram, oregano, hyssop, thyme, lavender, and perilla. Some species are shrubs, trees (such as teak), or, rarely, vines. Many members of the family are widely cultivated, not only for their aromatic qualities but also their ease of cultivation, since they are readily propagated by stem cuttings. Besides those grown for their edible leaves, some are grown for decorative foliage, such as Coleus. Others are grown for seed, such as Salvia hispanica (chia), or for their edible tubers, such as Plectranthus edulis, Plectranthus esculentus, Plectranthus rotundifolius, and Stachys affinis (Chinese artichoke).\r\n\r\nThe family has a cosmopolitan distribution. The enlarged Lamiaceae contains about 236 genera and has been stated to contain 6,900 to 7,200 species, but the World Checklist lists 7,534. The largest genera are Salvia (900), Scutellaria (360), Stachys (300), Plectranthus (300), Hyptis (280), Teucrium (250), Vitex (250), Thymus (220), and Nepeta (200). Clerodendrum was once a genus of over 400 species, but by 2010, it had been narrowed to about 150.\r\n\r\nThe family has traditionally been considered closely related to the Verbenaceae; in the 1990s, phylogenetic studies suggested that many genera classified in the Verbenaceae should be classified in the Lamiaceae  or to other families in the order Lamiales.\r\n\r\nThe alternate family name Labiatae refers to the fact that the flowers typically have petals fused into an upper lip and a lower lip (labia in Latin). The flowers are bilaterally symmetrical with five united petals and five united sepals. They are usually bisexual and verticillastrate (a flower cluster that looks like a whorl of flowers, but actually consists of two crowded clusters). Although this is still considered an acceptable alternative name, most botanists now use the name Lamiaceae in referring to this family. The leaves emerge oppositely, each pair at right angles to the previous one (decussate) or whorled. The stems are frequently square in cross section, but this is not found in all members of the family, and is sometimes found in other plant families.","sort":"Flower","alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/mint.png"},{"id":274,"name":"mountain dew","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:30.136Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:30.136Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/mountain dew.png"},{"id":275,"name":"nutmeg","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:31.125Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:31.125Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/nutmeg.png"},{"id":276,"name":"olive oil","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:31.463Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:31.463Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/olive oil.png"},{"id":277,"name":"olive","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:31.627Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:31.627Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/olive.png"},{"id":278,"name":"onion","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:31.789Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:31.789Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/onion.png"},{"id":279,"name":"orange bitters","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:32.119Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:32.119Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/orange bitters.png"},{"id":280,"name":"orange curacao","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:32.282Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:32.282Z","description":null,"sort":"Liqueur","alcohol":"Yes","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/orange curacao.png"},{"id":281,"name":"orange juice","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:32.446Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:32.446Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/orange juice.png"},{"id":282,"name":"orange liqueur","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:32.613Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:32.613Z","description":null,"sort":"Liqueur","alcohol":"Yes","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/orange liqueur.png"},{"id":283,"name":"orange peel","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:32.773Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:32.773Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/orange peel.png"},{"id":284,"name":"orange rum","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:32.939Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:32.939Z","description":null,"sort":"Rum","alcohol":"Yes","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/orange rum.png"},{"id":285,"name":"orange soda","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:33.111Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:33.111Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/orange soda.png"},{"id":286,"name":"orange spiral","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:33.277Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:33.277Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/orange spiral.png"},{"id":287,"name":"orange vodka","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:33.434Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:33.434Z","description":null,"sort":"Vodka","alcohol":"Yes","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/orange vodka.png"},{"id":288,"name":"orange","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:33.599Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:33.599Z","description":"The orange is the fruit of the citrus species Citrus × sinensis in the family Rutaceae. It is also called sweet orange, to distinguish it from the related Citrus × aurantium, referred to as bitter orange. The sweet orange reproduces asexually (apomixis through nucellar embryony); varieties of sweet orange arise through mutations.\r\n\r\nThe orange is a hybrid between pomelo (Citrus maxima) and mandarin (Citrus reticulata). It has genes that are ~25% pomelo and ~75% mandarin; however, it is not a simple backcrossed BC1 hybrid, but hybridized over multiple generations. The chloroplast genes, and therefore the maternal line, seem to be pomelo. The sweet orange has had its full genome sequenced. Earlier estimates of the percentage of pomelo genes varying from ~50% to 6% have been reported.\r\n\r\nSweet oranges were mentioned in Chinese literature in 314 BC. As of 1987, orange trees were found to be the most cultivated fruit tree in the world. Orange trees are widely grown in tropical and subtropical climates for their sweet fruit. The fruit of the orange tree can be eaten fresh, or processed for its juice or fragrant peel. As of 2012, sweet oranges accounted for approximately 70% of citrus production.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, 70.9 million tonnes of oranges were grown worldwide, with Brazil producing 24% of the world total followed by China and India.","sort":"Fruit","alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/orange.png"},{"id":289,"name":"oreo cookie","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:34.431Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:34.431Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/oreo cookie.png"},{"id":290,"name":"orgeat syrup","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:34.884Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:34.884Z","description":"Orgeat syrup is a sweet syrup made from almonds, sugar, and rose water or orange flower water. It was, however, originally made with a barley-almond blend. It has a pronounced almond taste and is used to flavor many cocktails, perhaps the most famous of which is the Mai Tai.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nThe word \"orgeat\" (/ɔːrˈʒɑː/ or /ˈɔːrdʒiːət/) is derived from the Latin hordeaceus \"made with barley\" through the French, where barley is called orge. The Catalan word orxata has the same origin, though today the two drinks have little else in common.\r\n\r\nIn Tunisia and Libya, it is called rozata and is usually served chilled in wedding and engagement parties as a symbol of joy and purity because of its white colour and its fresh (flowery) flavor. It comes in many different flavours, such as traditional almond, banana, mango, pistachio, among others.\r\n\r\nIn Suriname, there is a drink called orgeade, which is a similar syrup made of sugar and almonds.\r\n\r\nIn Italy, there is a drink called orzata, which is a syrup made of benzoin. It only contains some of the bitter almond flavour.\r\n\r\nMaltese ruġġata is made of almond and vanilla essence and may include cinnamon and cloves.\r\n\r\nIn Cyprus and on the Greek islands of Chios and Nisyros, a similar syrup is known as soumádha (Greek: σουμάδα).

Its taste is similar to other anise liquors like pastis, sambuca, arak, rakı, and mastika, that are traditionally produced and consumed in Mediterranean countries.\r\n\r\nOuzo has its roots in tsipouro, which is said to have been the work of a group of 14th-century monks on Mount Athos. One version of it was flavoured with anise. This version eventually came to be called ouzo.\r\n\r\nModern ouzo distillation largely took off in the beginning of the 19th century following Greek independence. The first ouzo distillery was founded in Tyrnavos in 1856 by Nikolaos Katsaros, giving birth to the famous ouzo Tyrnavou. When absinthe fell into disfavour in the early 20th century, ouzo was one of the products whose popularity rose to fill the gap; it was once called \"a substitute for absinthe without the wormwood\".[2] In 1932, ouzo producers developed a method of distillation using copper stills that is now the standard method of production. One of the largest producers of ouzo today is Varvayiannis (Βαρβαγιάννης),[citation needed] located in the town of Plomari in the southeast portion of the island of Lesbos, while in the same town Pitsiladi (Πιτσιλαδή), a variety of high-quality ouzo, is also distilled.\r\n\r\nOuzo is traditionally mixed with water, becoming cloudy white, sometimes with a faint blue tinge, and served with ice cubes in a small glass. Ouzo can also be drunk straight from a shot glass.\r\n\r\nOuzo is traditionally served with a small plate of a variety of appetizers called mezes, usually small fresh fish, fries, olives and feta cheese. Ouzo can be described to have a similar taste to absinthe which is liquorice-like, but smoother.\r\n\r\nOn October 25, 2006, Greece won the right to label ouzo as an exclusively Greek product. The European Union now recognizes ouzo, as well as the Greek drinks tsipouro and tsikoudia, as products with a Protected Designation of Origin, which prohibits European makers other than Greece and Cyprus from using the name.\r\n\r\nThere is an ouzo museum in Plomari, Lesvos.","sort":"Aperitif","alcohol":"Yes","perc":38,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/ouzo.png"},{"id":292,"name":"oyster sauce","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:35.223Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:35.223Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/oyster sauce.png"},{"id":293,"name":"papaya juice","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:35.388Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:35.388Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/papaya juice.png"},{"id":294,"name":"papaya","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:35.552Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:35.552Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/papaya.png"},{"id":295,"name":"parfait amour","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:35.715Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:35.715Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/parfait amour.png"},{"id":296,"name":"passion fruit juice","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:36.909Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:36.909Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/passion fruit juice.png"},{"id":297,"name":"passion fruit syrup","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:37.081Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:37.081Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/passion fruit syrup.png"},{"id":298,"name":"passoa","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:37.252Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:37.252Z","description":"Passoã is a passion fruit liqueur made in France, with passion fruit being the main ingredient.

Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production. Wines not made from grapes include rice wine and fruit wines such as plum, cherry, pomegranate and elderberry.\r\n\r\nWine has been produced for thousands of years. The earliest known traces of wine are from China (c. 7000 BC), Georgia (c. 6000 BC), Iran (c. 5000 BC), and Sicily (c. 4000 BC). The earliest known winery is the 6,100-year-old Areni-1 winery in Armenia. Wine reached the Balkans by 4500 BC and was consumed and celebrated in ancient Greece, Thrace and Rome. Throughout history, wine has been consumed for its intoxicating effects.\r\n\r\nWine has long played an important role in religion.

Unlike wine, in which alcohol (ethanol) is produced by fermenting sugar that is naturally present in fruit, typically grapes, sake is produced by a brewing process more akin to that of beer, where starch is converted into sugars which ferment into alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe brewing process for sake differs from the process for beer in that, for beer, the conversion from starch to sugar and from sugar to alcohol occurs in two distinct steps. Like other rice wines, when sake is brewed, these conversions occur simultaneously. Furthermore, the alcohol content differs between sake, wine, and beer. Wine generally contains 9%–16% ABV,[3] while most beer contains 3%–9%, and undiluted sake contains 18%–20% (although this is often lowered to about 15% by diluting with water prior to bottling).\r\n\r\nIn the Japanese language, the word \"sake\" (酒, \"liquor\", also pronounced shu) can refer to any alcoholic drink, while the beverage called \"sake\" in English is usually termed nihonshu (日本酒, \"Japanese liquor\").

Salt is present in vast quantities in seawater, where it is the main mineral constituent. The open ocean has about 35 grams (1.2 oz) of solids per litre, a salinity of 3.5%.\r\n\r\nSalt is essential for life in general, and saltiness is one of the basic human tastes. The tissues of animals contain larger quantities of salt than do plant tissues. Salt is one of the oldest and most ubiquitous food seasonings, and salting is an important method of food preservation.\r\n\r\nSome of the earliest evidence of salt processing dates to around 8,000 years ago, when people living in the area of present-day Romania boiled spring water to extract salts; a salt-works in China dates to approximately the same period. Salt was also prized by the ancient Hebrews, the Greeks, the Romans, the Byzantines, the Hittites, Egyptians, and the Indians. Salt became an important article of trade and was transported by boat across the Mediterranean Sea, along specially built salt roads, and across the Sahara on camel caravans. The scarcity and universal need for salt have led nations to go to war over it and use it to raise tax revenues. Salt is used in religious ceremonies and has other cultural significance.\r\n\r\nSalt is processed from salt mines, and by the evaporation of seawater (sea salt) and mineral-rich spring water in shallow pools. Its major industrial products are caustic soda and chlorine; salt is used in many industrial processes including the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride, plastics, paper pulp and many other products. Of the annual global production of around two hundred million tonnes of salt, only about 6% is used for human consumption. Other uses include water conditioning processes, de-icing highways, and agricultural use. Edible salt is sold in forms such as sea salt and table salt which usually contains an anti-caking agent and may be iodised to prevent iodine deficiency. As well as its use in cooking and at the table, salt is present in many processed foods.\r\n\r\nSodium is an essential nutrient for human health via its role as an electrolyte and osmotic solute. Excessive salt consumption may increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, in children and adults. Such health effects of salt have long been studied. Accordingly, numerous world health associations and experts in developed countries recommend reducing consumption of popular salty foods. The World Health Organization recommends that adults should consume less than 2,000 mg of sodium, equivalent to 5 grams of salt per day.","sort":"Mineral","alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/salt.png"},{"id":352,"name":"sambuca","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:48.500Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:48.500Z","description":"Sambuca (Italian pronunciation: [samˈbuːka]) is an Italian anise-flavoured, usually colourless, liqueur. Its most common variety is often referred to as white sambuca to differentiate it from other varieties that are deep blue in colour (black sambuca) or bright red (red sambuca). Like other anise-flavoured liqueurs, the ouzo effect is sometimes observed when combined with water.\r\n\r\nSambuca is flavoured with essential oils obtained from star anise, or less commonly, green anise. Other spices such as elderflower, liquorice and others may be included, but are not required as per the legal definition. It is bottled at a minimum of 38% alcohol by volume. The oils are added to pure alcohol, a concentrated solution of sugar, and other flavouring.\r\n\r\nThe Oxford English Dictionary states that the term comes from the Latin word sambucus, meaning \"elderberry\".\r\n\r\nThe Greek word Sambuca was first used as the name of another elderberry liquor that was created in Civitavecchia about 130 years ago.\r\n\r\nThe first commercial version of such a drink started at the end of 1800 in Civitavecchia, where Luigi Manzi sold Sambuca Manzi. In 1945, soon after the end of Second World War, commendatore Angelo Molinari started producing Sambuca Extra Molinari, which helped popularise Sambuca throughout Italy.\r\n\r\nHaving both originated as anise based spirits containing elderberry, Sambuca shared some commonality with the Basque drink Patxaran.","sort":"Liqueur","alcohol":"Yes","perc":38,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/sambuca.png"},{"id":353,"name":"sarsaparilla","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:48.665Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:48.665Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/sarsaparilla.png"},{"id":354,"name":"schnapps","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:48.826Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:48.826Z","description":"Schnapps (/ʃnɑːps/ or /ʃnæps/) or schnaps is a type of alcoholic beverage that may take several forms, including distilled fruit brandies, herbal liqueurs, infusions, and \"flavored liqueurs\" made by adding fruit syrups, spices, or artificial flavorings to neutral grain spirits.\r\n\r\nThe English loanword \"schnapps\" is derived from the colloquial German word Schnaps [ʃnaps] (About this sound listen) (plural: Schnäpse) which is used in reference to spirit drinks.

Sherry is produced in a variety of styles made primarily from the Palomino grape, ranging from light versions similar to white table wines, such as Manzanilla and Fino, to darker and heavier versions that have been allowed to oxidise as they age in barrel, such as Amontillado and Oloroso. Sweet dessert wines are also made from Pedro Ximenez or Moscatel grapes, and are sometimes blended with Palomino-based Sherries.\r\n\r\nThe word \"Sherry\" is an anglicisation of Xeres (Jerez). Sherry was previously known as sack, from the Spanish saca, meaning \"extraction\" from the solera. In Europe, \"Sherry\" has protected designation of origin status, and under Spanish law, all wine labelled as \"Sherry\" must legally come from the Sherry Triangle, an area in the province of Cádiz between Jerez de la Frontera, Sanlúcar de Barrameda, and El Puerto de Santa María. In 1933 the Jerez Denominación de Origen was the first Spanish denominación to be officially recognised in this way, officially named D.O. Jerez-Xeres-Sherry and sharing the same governing council as D.O. Manzanilla Sanlúcar de Barrameda.\r\n\r\nAfter fermentation is complete, the base wines are fortified with grape spirit in order to increase their final alcohol content. Wines classified as suitable for aging as Fino and Manzanilla are fortified until they reach a total alcohol content of 15.5 per cent by volume. As they age in barrel, they develop a layer of flor—a yeast-like growth that helps protect the wine from excessive oxidation. Those wines that are classified to undergo aging as Oloroso are fortified to reach an alcohol content of at least 17 per cent. They do not develop flor and so oxidise slightly as they age, giving them a darker colour. Because the fortification takes place after fermentation, most sherries are initially dry, with any sweetness being added later. In contrast, port wine is fortified halfway through its fermentation, which stops the process so that not all of the sugar is turned into alcohol.\r\n\r\nWines from different years are aged and blended using a solera system before bottling, so that bottles of sherry will not usually carry a specific vintage year and can contain a small proportion of very old wine. Sherry is regarded by many wine writers as \"underappreciated\" and a \"neglected wine treasure\".","sort":"Fortified Wine","alcohol":"Yes","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/sherry.png"},{"id":359,"name":"sirup of roses","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:50.401Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:50.401Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/sirup of roses.png"},{"id":360,"name":"sloe gin","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:50.568Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:50.568Z","description":"Sloe gin is a red liqueur made with gin and sloe (blackthorn) drupes, which are a small fruit relative of the plum. Sloe gin has an alcohol content between 15 and 30 percent by volume. However, the European Union has established a minimum of 25% ABV for sloe gin to be named as such. The traditional way of making sloe gin is to soak the sloes in gin. Sugar is required to ensure the sloe juice is extracted from the fruit.\r\n\r\nMany commercial sloe gins today are made by flavouring less expensive neutral grain spirits, although some manufacturers still use the traditional method. Currently, Spirit Works Distillery out of Sebastopol in Sonoma County, California is the only traditional producer of Sloe Gin in the US.

It is cultivated worldwide for its fruit. The fruit is widely appreciated for its characteristic aroma, bright red color, juicy texture, and sweetness. It is consumed in large quantities, either fresh or in such prepared foods as preserves, juice, pies, ice creams, milkshakes, and chocolates. Artificial strawberry flavorings and aromas are also widely used in many products like lip gloss, candy, hand sanitizers, perfume, and many others.\r\n\r\nThe garden strawberry was first bred in Brittany, France, in the 1750s via a cross of Fragaria virginiana from eastern North America and Fragaria chiloensis, which was brought from Chile by Amédée-François Frézier in 1714. Cultivars of Fragaria × ananassa have replaced, in commercial production, the woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca), which was the first strawberry species cultivated in the early 17th century.\r\n\r\nThe strawberry is not, from a botanical point of view, a berry. Technically, it is an aggregate accessory fruit, meaning that the fleshy part is derived not from the plant's ovaries but from the receptacle that holds the ovaries.Each apparent \"seed\" (achene) on the outside of the fruit is actually one of the ovaries of the flower, with a seed inside it.","sort":"Fruit","alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/strawberries.png"},{"id":374,"name":"strawberry juice","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:53.458Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:53.458Z","description":null,"sort":null,"alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/strawberry juice.png"},{"id":375,"name":"strawberry liqueur","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:53.620Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:53.620Z","description":null,"sort":"Liquor","alcohol":"Yes","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/strawberry liqueur.png"},{"id":376,"name":"strawberry schnapps","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:53.775Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:44:53.775Z","description":"Schnapps (/ʃnɑːps/ or /ʃnæps/) or schnaps is a type of alcoholic beverage that may take several forms, including distilled fruit brandies, herbal liqueurs, infusions, and \"flavored liqueurs\" made by adding fruit syrups, spices, or artificial flavorings to neutral grain spirits.\n\nThe English loanword \"schnapps\" is derived from the colloquial German word Schnaps [ʃnaps] (About this sound listen) (plural: Schnäpse) which is used in reference to spirit drinks.

In addition to being consumed as an aperitif or cocktail ingredient, vermouth is sometimes used as an alternative white wine in cooking.\r\n\r\nHistorically, there have been two main types of vermouth: sweet and dry. Responding to demand and competition, vermouth manufacturers have created additional styles, including extra-dry white, sweet white (bianco), red, amber (ambre or rosso), and rosé. Vermouth is produced by starting with a base of a neutral grape wine or unfermented wine must. Each manufacturer adds additional alcohol and a proprietary mixture of dry ingredients, consisting of aromatic herbs, roots, and barks, to the base wine, base wine plus spirit or spirit only – which may be redistilled before adding to the wine or unfermented wine must. After the wine is aromatized and fortified, the vermouth is sweetened with either cane sugar or caramelized sugar, depending on the style.

Originally used as a prophylactic against malaria, tonic water usually now has a significantly lower quinine content and is consumed for its distinctive bitter flavour. It is often used in mixed drinks, particularly in gin and tonic.\r\n\r\nThe quinine was added to the drink as a prophylactic against malaria, since it was originally intended for consumption in tropical areas of South Asia and Africa, where the disease is endemic. Quinine powder was so bitter that British officials stationed in early 19th Century India and other tropical posts began mixing the powder with soda and sugar, and a basic tonic water was created. The first commercial tonic water was produced in 1858. The mixed drink gin and tonic also originated in British colonial India, when the British population would mix their medicinal quinine tonic with gin.\r\n\r\nSince 2010, at least four tonic syrups have been released in the United States.

While vermouth was traditionally used for medicinal purposes, its true claim to fame is as an aperitif, with fashionable cafes in Turin serving it to guests around the clock. However, in the late 19th century it became popular with bartenders as a key ingredient in many classic cocktails that have survived to date, such as the Martini, the Manhattan, the Rob Roy, and the Negroni. In addition to being consumed as an aperitif or cocktail ingredient, vermouth is sometimes used as an alternative white wine in cooking.\r\n\r\nHistorically, there have been two main types of vermouth: sweet and dry. Responding to demand and competition, vermouth manufacturers have created additional styles, including extra-dry white, sweet white (bianco), red, amber (ambre or rosso), and rosé. Vermouth is produced by starting with a base of a neutral grape wine or unfermented wine must. Each manufacturer adds additional alcohol and a proprietary mixture of dry ingredients, consisting of aromatic herbs, roots, and barks, to the base wine, base wine plus spirit or spirit only – which may be redistilled before adding to the wine or unfermented wine must. After the wine is aromatized and fortified, the vermouth is sweetened with either cane sugar or caramelized sugar, depending on the style.

Its chemical formula is H2O, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms that are connected by covalent bonds. Strictly speaking, water refers to the liquid state of a substance that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity.\r\n\r\nWater covers 71% of the Earth's surface.[1] It is vital for all known forms of life. On Earth, 96.5% of the planet's crust water is found in seas and oceans, 1.7% in groundwater, 1.7% in glaciers and the ice caps of Antarctica and Greenland, a small fraction in other large water bodies, 0.001% in the air as vapor, clouds (formed of ice and liquid water suspended in air), and precipitation. Only 2.5% of this water is freshwater, and 98.8% of that water is in ice (excepting ice in clouds) and groundwater. Less than 0.3% of all freshwater is in rivers, lakes, and the atmosphere, and an even smaller amount of the Earth's freshwater (0.003%) is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products. A greater quantity of water is found in the earth's interior.\r\n\r\nWater on Earth moves continually through the water cycle of evaporation and transpiration (evapotranspiration), condensation, precipitation, and runoff, usually reaching the sea. Evaporation and transpiration contribute to the precipitation over land. Large amounts of water are also chemically combined or adsorbed in hydrated minerals.\r\n\r\nSafe drinking water is essential to humans and other lifeforms even though it provides no calories or organic nutrients. Access to safe drinking water has improved over the last decades in almost every part of the world, but approximately one billion people still lack access to safe water and over 2.5 billion lack access to adequate sanitation. There is a clear correlation between access to safe water and gross domestic product per capita. However, some observers have estimated that by 2025 more than half of the world population will be facing water-based vulnerability. A report, issued in November 2009, suggests that by 2030, in some developing regions of the world, water demand will exceed supply by 50%.\r\n\r\nWater plays an important role in the world economy. Approximately 70% of the freshwater used by humans goes to agriculture. Fishing in salt and fresh water bodies is a major source of food for many parts of the world. Much of long-distance trade of commodities (such as oil and natural gas) and manufactured products is transported by boats through seas, rivers, lakes, and canals. Large quantities of water, ice, and steam are used for cooling and heating, in industry and homes. Water is an excellent solvent for a wide variety of chemical substances; as such it is widely used in industrial processes, and in cooking and washing. Water is also central to many sports and other forms of entertainment, such as swimming, pleasure boating, boat racing, surfing, sport fishing, and diving.","sort":"Water","alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/water.png"},{"id":409,"name":"watermelon schnapps","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:45:00.466Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:45:00.466Z","description":"Schnapps (/ʃnɑːps/ or /ʃnæps/) or schnaps is a type of alcoholic beverage that may take several forms, including distilled fruit brandies, herbal liqueurs, infusions, and \"flavored liqueurs\" made by adding fruit syrups, spices, or artificial flavorings to neutral grain spirits.\n\nThe English loanword \"schnapps\" is derived from the colloquial German word Schnaps [ʃnaps] (About this sound listen) (plural: Schnäpse) which is used in reference to spirit drinks.

The distillery is located near Lawrenceburg, Kentucky, United States. It offers tours, and is part of the American Whiskey Trail and the Kentucky Bourbon Trail.\r\n\r\nIn 1891, Thomas Ripy built the Old Hickory Distillery in Tyrone, Kentucky, near Lawrenceburg, on the former site of the Old Moore Distillery. After Prohibition, the Ripy family (Thomas had died in 1902) repaired the distillery and began to again produce bourbon. The Ripys sold the bourbon produced at this distillery to various wholesalers who bottled bourbon under their own brands. Austin Nichols was one of these wholesalers.\r\n\r\nThe \"Wild Turkey\" brand is said to have arisen after an Austin Nichols executive, Thomas McCarthy, took some warehouse samples on a wild turkey hunting trip in 1940. The bourbon proved so popular among his friends they continued to ask him for \"that wild turkey bourbon.\" Austin Nichols began to bottle Wild Turkey in 1942.\r\n\r\nThe Ripys were bought out in 1949 by Robert and Alvin Gould.\r\n\r\nFor three decades after introducing Wild Turkey, Austin Nichols remained a non-distiller producer—bottling bourbon purchased on the open market under their Wild Turkey brand. Much of this whiskey was purchased from the Ripys/Gould distillery in Tyrone. In 1971, Austin Nichols purchased the facility (then known as the Boulevard Distillery) and changed the name to the Wild Turkey Distillery.\r\n\r\nIn 1980, the distillery and the Wild Turkey brand were purchased by Pernod Ricard.\r\n\r\nOn May 9, 2000, a fire destroyed a seven-story aging warehouse at the company in Anderson County, Kentucky. It contained more than 17,000 wooden barrels of whiskey. Burning whiskey flowed from the warehouse, setting the woods on fire, causing limestone deposits to explode. Firefighters saved Lawrenceburg's water treatment plant from destruction. However, an estimated 20% of the whiskey flowed into the Kentucky River. The river contamination required the temporary shutdown of the water treatment plant. Officials ordered water usage restrictions. Businesses and schools were closed because of the water shortage. The alcohol spill also depleted the oxygen in the river, killing an estimated 228,000 fish along a 66-mile stretch. The EPA and the Coast Guard's Gulf Strike Team aerated the river using equipment mounted on barges.[6] The company paid $256,000 to the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife in an effort to restore the fish population in the river.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, the Campari Group acquired the distillery and the Wild Turkey brand from Pernod Ricard.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Wild Turkey began to be distilled at a newly constructed facility near the old distillery. The new distillery sits where the old bottling facility was previously located.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, Campari opened a new bottling facility at the Wild Turkey Distillery. For the previous 13 years Wild Turkey had been bottled offsite in Indiana and, later, Arkansas. In addition to the Wild Turkey products, Campari's SKYY vodka is also bottled there after being shipped from the Illinois distillery.","sort":"Whisky","alcohol":"yes","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/wild turkey.png"},{"id":420,"name":"wildberry schnapps","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:45:02.620Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:45:02.620Z","description":"Schnapps (/ʃnɑːps/ or /ʃnæps/) or schnaps is a type of alcoholic beverage that may take several forms, including distilled fruit brandies, herbal liqueurs, infusions, and \"flavored liqueurs\" made by adding fruit syrups, spices, or artificial flavorings to neutral grain spirits.\n\nThe English loanword \"schnapps\" is derived from the colloquial German word Schnaps [ʃnaps] (About this sound listen) (plural: Schnäpse) which is used in reference to spirit drinks.

Some may be vegetarian or vegan, and may add other spices.\r\n\r\nWorcestershire sauce is complex and unique in its flavour and aroma, and frequently used to enhance some food and drink recipes. For example, it is often an ingredient in Welsh rarebit, Caesar salad, Oysters Kirkpatrick, deviled eggs, and sometimes an ingredient in chili con carne, beef stew or other beef dishes.

Fermentation of lactose by these bacteria produces lactic acid, which acts on milk protein to give yogurt its texture and characteristic tart flavor. Cow's milk is commonly available worldwide, and, as such, is the milk most commonly used to make yogurt. Milk from water buffalo, goats, ewes, mares, camels, and yaks is also used to produce yogurt where available locally. Milk used may be homogenized or not (milk distributed in many parts of the world is homogenized); both types may be used, with substantially different results.\r\n\r\nYogurt is produced using a culture of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus bacteria. In addition, other lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are also sometimes added during or after culturing yogurt. Some countries require yogurt to contain a certain amount of colony-forming units of bacteria; in China, for example, the requirement for the number of lactobacillus bacteria is at least 1 × 106 CFU per milliliter.\r\n\r\nTo produce yogurt, milk is first heated, usually to about 85 °C (185 °F), to denature the milk proteins so that they do not form curds. After heating, the milk is allowed to cool to about 45 °C (113 °F).

It is made in the form of a liquid, paste, or in a block, or used as a flavoring ingredient in other foods. Cacao has been cultivated by many cultures for at least three millennia in Mesoamerica. The earliest evidence of use traces to the Mokaya (Mexico and Guatemala), with evidence of chocolate beverages dating back to 1900 BCE.[1] In fact, the majority of Mesoamerican people made chocolate beverages, including the Maya and Aztecs, who made it into a beverage known as xocolātl Nahuatl pronunciation: [ʃoˈkolaːt͡ɬ], a Nahuatl word meaning \"bitter water\". The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor.\r\n\r\nAfter fermentation, the beans are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce cacao nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass, unadulterated chocolate in rough form. Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate liquor. The liquor also may be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Baking chocolate, also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions, without any added sugars. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa butter or added vegetable oils, and sugar. Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk. White chocolate contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids.\r\n\r\nCocoa solids are a source of flavonoids and alkaloids, such as theobromine, phenethylamine and caffeine. Chocolate also contains anandamide.\r\n\r\nChocolate has become one of the most popular food types and flavors in the world, and a vast number of foodstuffs involving chocolate have been created, particularly desserts including cakes, pudding, mousse, chocolate brownies, and chocolate chip cookies. Many candies are filled with or coated with sweetened chocolate, and bars of solid chocolate and candy bars coated in chocolate are eaten as snacks. Gifts of chocolate molded into different shapes (e.g., eggs, hearts, coins) have become traditional on certain Western holidays, such as Easter, Valentine's Day, and Hanukkah. Chocolate is also used in cold and hot beverages such as chocolate milk and hot chocolate and in some alcoholic drinks, such as creme de cacao.\r\n\r\nAlthough cocoa originated in the Americas, recent years have seen African nations assuming a leading role in producing cocoa. Since the 2000s, Western Africa produces almost two-thirds of the world's cocoa, with Ivory Coast growing almost half of that amount.","sort":"Confectionery","alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/salted chocolate.png"},{"id":436,"name":"martini rosso","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:45:05.438Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:45:05.438Z","description":"Martini is a brand of Italian vermouth, named after the Martini \u0026 Rossi Distilleria Nazionale di Spirito di Vino, in Turin.\r\n\r\nClemente Michel, Carlo Re, Carlo Agnelli and Eligio Baudino started the company in 1847, as a vermouth bottling plant in Pessione.

The rights to the brand are held by Dr Pepper Snapple Group in the United States, and PepsiCo (or its licensees) in the rest of the world. The U.S. version of the 7 Up logo includes a red cherry between the \"7\" and \"Up\"; this red cherry has been animated and used as a mascot for the brand as Cool Spot.\r\n\r\n7 Up was created by Charles Leiper Grigg, who launched his St. Louis–based company The Howdy Corporation in 1920.[1] Grigg came up with the formula for a lemon-lime soft drink in 1929. The product, originally named \"Bib-Label Lithiated Lemon-Lime Soda\", was launched two weeks before the Wall Street Crash of 1929.[2] It contained lithium citrate, a mood-stabilizing drug, until 1950.[3] It was one of a number of patent medicine products popular in the late-19th and early-20th centuries. Its name was later shortened to \"7 Up Lithiated Lemon Soda\" before being further shortened to just \"7 Up\" by 1936.\r\n\r\nWestinghouse bought 7 Up in 1969 and sold it in 1978 to Philip Morris, who then in 1986 sold it to a group led by the investment firm Hicks \u0026 Haas.[4] 7 Up merged with Dr Pepper in 1988; Cadbury Schweppes bought the combined company in 1995. The Dr Pepper Snapple Group was spun off from Cadbury Schweppes in 2008.\r\n\r\n7 Up has been reformulated several times since its launch in 1929. In 2006, the version of the product sold in the U.S. was re-formulated so that it could be marketed as being \"100% natural\". This was achieved by eliminating the chelating-agent calcium disodium EDTA, and replacing sodium citrate with potassium citrate in order to reduce the beverage's sodium content.[5] This re-formulation contains no fruit juice and, in the U.S., is sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS). The manufacturing process used in the production of HFCS has led some public health and advocacy groups to challenge the ad campaign's \"natural\" claims.[6] In 2007, after the Center for Science in the Public Interest threatened to sue 7 Up, it was announced that 7 Up would stop being marketed as \"100% natural\". Instead, it is now promoted as having \"100% Natural Flavors\". The controversy does not extend to other countries, such as the United Kingdom, where HFCS is not generally used in foods, including 7 Up. In 2011, 7 Up began test-marketing a formula, called 7 Up Retro, using sugar rather than HFCS. Container labels sport the caption, \"Made With Real Sugar\".\r\n\r\nThere exists a myth that the 7 Up name comes from the drink having a pH over 7. That would make it neutral or basic on the scale; however, this is not the case, as the 7 Up pH is close to 3.79, similar to other drinks of the type.[7] The real origin of the name is unclear,[8] though Britvic claims that the name comes from the seven main ingredients in the drink,[9] while others have claimed that the number was a coded reference to the lithium contained in the original recipe, which has an atomic mass of approximately 7.","sort":"Soft Drink","alcohol":null,"perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/7-up.png"},{"id":463,"name":"absinthe","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:45:10.638Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:45:10.638Z","description":"Absinthe is historically described as a distilled, highly alcoholic (45–74% ABV / 90–148 U.S. proof) beverage.[1][2][3][4] It is an anise-flavoured spirit derived from botanicals, including the flowers and leaves of Artemisia absinthium (\"grand wormwood\"), together with green anise, sweet fennel, and other medicinal and culinary herbs.[5] Absinthe traditionally has a natural green colour but may also be colourless. It is commonly referred to in historical literature as \"la fée verte\" (the green fairy). Although it is sometimes mistakenly referred to as a liqueur, absinthe is not traditionally bottled with added sugar; it is therefore classified as a spirit.[6] Absinthe is traditionally bottled at a high level of alcohol by volume, but it is normally diluted with water prior to being consumed.\r\n\r\nAbsinthe originated in the canton of Neuchâtel in Switzerland in the late 18th century. It rose to great popularity as an alcoholic drink in late 19th- and early 20th-century France, particularly among Parisian artists and writers. Owing in part to its association with bohemian culture, the consumption of absinthe was opposed by social conservatives and prohibitionists. Ernest Hemingway, James Joyce, Charles Baudelaire, Paul Verlaine, Arthur Rimbaud, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Amedeo Modigliani, Pablo Picasso, Vincent van Gogh, Oscar Wilde, Marcel Proust, Aleister Crowley, Erik Satie, Edgar Allan Poe, Lord Byron and Alfred Jarry were all known absinthe drinkers.\r\n\r\nAbsinthe has often been portrayed as a dangerously addictive psychoactive drug and hallucinogen. The chemical compound thujone, although present in the spirit in only trace amounts, was blamed for its alleged harmful effects. By 1915, absinthe had been banned in the United States and in much of Europe, including France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Austria-Hungary. Although absinthe was vilified, it has not been demonstrated to be any more dangerous than ordinary spirits. Recent studies have shown that absinthe's psychoactive properties (apart from that of the alcohol) have been exaggerated. A revival of absinthe began in the 1990s, following the adoption of modern European Union food and beverage laws that removed longstanding barriers to its production and sale. By the early 21st century, nearly 200 brands of absinthe were being produced in a dozen countries, most notably in France, Switzerland, Australia, Spain, and the Czech Republic.","sort":"Spirit","alcohol":"Yes","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/absinthe.png"},{"id":464,"name":"absolut citron","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:45:10.802Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:45:10.802Z","description":"Absolut Vodka is a brand of vodka, produced near Åhus, in southern Sweden. Absolut is owned by French group Pernod Ricard; they bought Absolut for €5.63 billion in 2008 from the Swedish state. Absolut is the third largest brand of alcoholic spirits in the world after Bacardi and Smirnoff, and is sold in 126 countries.\r\n\r\nAbsolut was established in 1879 by Lars Olsson Smith and is produced in Åhus, Sweden.[1] Smith challenged the city of Stockholm's liquor marketing monopoly with his vodka. It was sold at a lower price than the monopoly's product, just outside the city border. Smith even offered free boat rides to the distillery and \"Rent Brännvin\" made Smith a fortune.\r\n\r\nIn 1917, the alcohol industry in Sweden was monopolized by the Swedish government. Vodka was then sold nationwide under the name \"Absolut Rent Brännvin\". The name changed with intervals, Renat Brännvin or Absolut Rent Brännvin. In 1979, the old name Absolut was picked up when the upper-price range ABSOLUT VODKA was introduced. Renat is still a euphemism for spirits in Sweden, and the name of another vodka product by Vin \u0026 Sprit.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbsolut Vodka was introduced to the global market in 1979. Since its launch, Absolut has grown from 90,000 liters to 96.6 million liters in 2008. It has become the largest international spirit and is available in 126 countries. The vodka is made from winter wheat. Approximately 80,000 metric tons (2,900,000 bushels) of wheat are used annually to produce Absolut Vodka. Over one kilogram of grain is used in every one-liter bottle.","sort":"Vodka","alcohol":"Yes","perc":null,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/absolut citron.png"},{"id":465,"name":"creme de mure","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:45:10.960Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:45:10.960Z","description":"Home-made blackberry liqueur, a warming, sweet drink for the winter months","sort":"Liquor","alcohol":"Yes","perc":16,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/creme de mure.png"},{"id":466,"name":"olive brine","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:45:11.132Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:45:11.132Z","description":"Olive brine — or olive juice — is simply a mixture of salt, vinegar and water but as olives marinate, the liquid takes on a fantastically rich and delicious olive flavor.

Various grains (which may be malted) are used for different varieties, including barley, corn (maize), rye, and wheat. Whisky is typically aged in wooden casks, generally made of charred white oak.\r\n\r\nWhisky is a strictly regulated spirit worldwide with many classes and types. The typical unifying characteristics of the different classes and types are the fermentation of grains, distillation, and aging in wooden barrels.\r\n\r\nThe word whisky (or whiskey) is an anglicisation of the Classical Gaelic word uisce (or uisge) meaning \"water\" (now written as uisce in Irish Gaelic, and uisge in Scottish Gaelic). Distilled alcohol was known in Latin as aqua vitae (\"water of life\"). This was translated to Classical Gaelic as Irish: uisce beatha/Scottish Gaelic: uisge beatha \"water of life\". Early forms of the word in English included uskebeaghe (1581), usquebaugh (1610), usquebath (1621), and usquebae (1715).\r\n\r\nIt is possible that distillation was practised by the Babylonians in Mesopotamia in the 2nd millennium BC, with perfumes and aromatics being distilled, but this is subject to uncertain and disputed interpretation of evidence. The earliest certain chemical distillations were by Greeks in Alexandria in the 1st century AD, but these were not distillations of alcohol. The medieval Arabs adopted the distillation technique of the Alexandrian Greeks, and written records in Arabic begin in the 9th century, but again these were not distillations of alcohol. Distilling technology passed from the medieval Arabs to the medieval Latins, with the earliest records in Latin in the early 12th century. The earliest records of the distillation of alcohol are in Italy in the 13th century, where alcohol was distilled from wine. An early description of the technique was given by Ramon Llull (1232 – 1315). Its use spread through medieval monasteries, largely for medicinal purposes, such as the treatment of colic and smallpox.\r\n\r\nThe art of distillation spread to Ireland and Scotland no later than the 15th century, as did the common European practice of distilling \"aqua vitae\" or spirit alcohol primarily for medicinal purposes. The practice of medicinal distillation eventually passed from a monastic setting to the secular via professional medical practitioners of the time, The Guild of Barber Surgeons. The earliest Irish mention of whisky comes from the seventeenth-century Annals of Clonmacnoise, which attributes the death of a chieftain in 1405 to \"taking a surfeit of aqua vitae\" at Christmas. In Scotland, the first evidence of whisky production comes from an entry in the Exchequer Rolls for 1494 where malt is sent \"To Friar John Cor, by order of the king, to make aquavitae\", enough to make about 500 bottles.\r\n\r\nA still for making whisky is usually made of copper, since it removes sulfur-based compounds from the alcohol that would make it unpleasant to drink. Modern stills are made of stainless steel with copper innards (piping, for example, will be lined with copper along with copper plate inlays along still walls). The simplest standard distillation apparatus is commonly known as a pot still, consisting of a single heated chamber and a vessel to collect purified alcohol.\r\n\r\nColumn stills are frequently used in the production of grain whisky and are the most commonly used type of still in the production of bourbon and other American whiskeys. Column stills behave like a series of single pot stills, formed in a long vertical tube. Whereas a single pot still charged with wine might yield a vapour enriched to 40–50% alcohol, a column still can achieve a vapour alcohol content of 95.6%; an azeotropic mixture of alcohol and water.","sort":"Whisky","alcohol":"Yes","perc":40,"photo_url":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/ingredients/whiskey.png"},{"id":471,"name":"whisky","created_at":"2020-04-14T06:45:15.150Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T06:45:15.150Z","description":"Whisky or whiskey is a type of distilled alcoholic beverage made from fermented grain mash.
